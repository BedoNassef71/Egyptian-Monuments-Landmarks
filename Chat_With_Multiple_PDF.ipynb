caMeron aspley Publisher, aMerIcan BusIness\\nN\\nEVER in the history of the United States has the time been so favorable for a\\nman with small capital to start his own business as it is today.\\nFor some time now the world has been slowly but steadily recovering from\\nthe disruptions and economic shocks that came in the wake of the World\\nWar. The ratio of debts to incomes is rapidly being equalized. Farsighted\\nmonetary reforms, especially in the sterling group of countries, have been\\nmade. While we are by no means back in the hectic prosperity days of 1929,and there still exists considerable unemployment, even the most pessimistic\\nman must concede that the last two or three years have put us all on a firmer\\nfooting. In fact, a great number of companies have managed to reach their\\nsales peak since the black days of 1935. Business does exist for the man who\\nwill work and plan for it.\\nHere in the United States, legislation has been enacted that is particularly\\nfavorable to the small business man. Obstacles, inadvertently put in his way\\nby early activities of the administration, have given way to a sincere desire to\\nhelp the small business man, who is the real backbone of American industry.\\nAgencies have been set up especially to protect and help him. He is the\\n“white haired” boy of the new order of things.\\nWe have all heard a great deal about the opportunities of bygone years. We\\nenvy the men who discovered and settled the West. We wish that all the\\nrailroads were not built so that those opportunities would still be open. Why,\\nthe opportunities of yesterday are as nothing compared with the opportunities\\nthat await the courageous, resourceful man today! There are fortunes to be\\nmade that will make those of Astor and Rockefeller seem picayune.\\nEver since the beginning of time the world has made way for the determined\\nman with a real idea for serving his fellow men. In ancient Egypt, in classical\\nGreece, in legalistic Rome, as in every succeeding stage of civilization,\\nsociety has rewarded those who served it best. It will continue to do so for\\nmany thousands of years to come.\\nSo if you have the urge to go into business, or to lay the foundation for a\\nfuture business by capitalizing your spare time, delay no longer. If you wait\\nfor conditions, conditions may leave you in the lurch. Determine upon some\\nplan of action that will enable you to render a needed service to your\\ncommunity. Put your whole heart and soul into rendering that service. Face\\nthe disappointments that go with starting in business resolutely and\\ncourageously. Cultivate courtesy and consideration of others. Work as you\\nnever worked before, and you will succeed. But you cannot possibly succeed\\nuntil you start. Nor can you succeed unless you serve.Good luck to you in the most fascinating game in all the world—the great\\ngame of business.\\nchapter one\\nHOW TO START YOUR OWN BUSINESS\\nW\\nHEN Gustavus Swift, a youngster in knee breeches, dressed and sold his first\\ncalf to the fisher folk of Cape Cod, he laid the foundation of the largest meat\\npacking business in the world. The desire to make money—to have a\\nbusiness of his own—was a driving force in the make-up of young Swift. In\\nBarnstable he was known as a chap with a lot of “get up and go” to him. So it\\nwas not surprising that when he felt the desire to make money, he didn’t\\nwaste his time wishing, but took his courage in his two hands and started in\\nthe dressed beef business in his dad’s back yard.\\nNo doubt there were other young men in Barnstable who wanted to make\\nmoney too. But while they were wondering how they could make it, Gus\\nSwift cut the Gordian knot. It meant work for him. It was not a pleasant way\\nto make money. There was the possibility of his not being able to sell his calf\\nafter he had dressed it. He had to walk miles in order to market his veal, for\\nCape Cod in those days was a “spread out” sort of place. But Swift didn’t\\ncare. He wanted the money. The work, the walking and the adventure were\\nfun. And because he regarded making money as fun instead of work, he later\\nwas able to come to Chicago and start the great Swift packing business. How\\ndifferent from the average young men of today! They are usually more\\ninterested in having a good time than they are establishing themselves in a\\nbusiness of their own. Being in business is so confining! So they concentrate\\non enjoying themselves, serene in their philosophy that tomorrow is another\\nday. If these people, and they are not all young people either, worked half as\\nhard at making money as they do at having a good time, they would be rich.\\nThen there are people who are willing to work and do work hard at making\\nmoney, but they are not successful because they lack a target. They are like\\nthe chap who hunts big game with a shotgun. They do a lot of shooting, but\\nthey bag very little game. Next to being willing to pay the price of success in\\nhard work, the most important thing is to have a definite, clear-cut objective.Since it is necessary to crawl before you walk, it is suggested that you make\\nthat objective $1,000.\\nNow you may say, why stop at $1,000? Why not make it $100,000? While\\nthere is merit in the idea of setting up your sights high, there is such a thing\\nas shooting at the moon. Set an objective that you know you can attain.\\nHaving attained your first objective, you can then consider what your next\\nobjective will be. Remember that after you start in business you are going to\\nrun afoul of many discouragements. While it looks easy now, it may not two\\nmonths from now. If you have as an objective a mark that you can almost\\nreach out and touch, it will help you to carry through this period of\\ndiscouragement.\\nThe Story of Money\\nSince this is a book about making money, and money will be mentioned\\nfrequently, it might be in order to get it clearly fixed in our minds what\\nmoney is. Money itself is no good. You cannot eat it. You cannot wear it.\\nYou cannot use it for much of anything except to exchange for things which\\nyou need. That is why it is called a “medium of exchange.” Money can be\\nanything. In the early days of the West whiskey was used for money. A farm\\nwas advertised as being worth so many barrels of whiskey. Beads were used\\nby the Indians as a medium of exchange. The island of Manhattan was\\nbought from the Indians for a few beads. The first use of coins as money\\nantedates Christ. To save people the trouble of having to weigh each coin to\\ndetermine its value, the government stamped them with its mark. They could\\nthen be passed in exchange without using scales, although even today the\\nbanks in Great Britain weigh all gold coins presented to them to determine\\nthe wear.\\nOne of the first countries to use credit money as a medium of exchange was\\nEngland. People took their silver to the Exchequer and received in exchange\\na tally stick. Notches were cut in this stick according to the number of\\n“pounds” of silver loaned to the government. These tally sticks were about\\nthree-quarters of an inch square and about ten inches long. After being\\nnotched, the stick was split in half, and one-half was hung in the Exchequer,and the other half given to the person loaning the silver. At first these tally\\nsticks were used as receipts only, but after a time people exchanged them for\\nthings they needed. Then the Exchequer issued tally sticks notched for even\\nnumber of pounds of silver—one pound, five pounds, twenty pounds and so\\nforth. These were much more convenient than carrying around the actual\\nsilver. Eventually the tally stick was superseded by paper receipts, the\\nforerunner of our present paper money. The big advantage of the tally stick\\nwas that no two sticks were notched in the same way, so that when the owner\\nof a tally stick called at the Exchequer to collect, the notching on his tally\\nstick certified to his ownership of the silver. It remained for John Law, the\\neminent Scotch banker, to carry money to its next stage of development—\\npieces of paper secured by various kinds of assets, and too often by nothing at\\nall.\\nIt is important to know how our present system of money grew, so you will\\nunderstand its true place in our scheme of business. When you determine to\\nmake $1,000 you are not thinking of ten one-hundred-dollar bills so much as\\nyou are thinking in terms of what you can buy with those bills. And the same\\nis true of those from whom you get money. You both talk about money as\\nthough money was all important, but actually you are exchanging services.\\nSo your success in making your first $1,000 will depend upon your ability to\\nmake or do something, of definite value to society, which people want more\\nthan they want the money it will cost them.\\nIn the years gone by, there was money in making and selling carriages. Based\\non figures alone it might seem like a good thing to start in the carriage\\nbusiness. But even the most casual investigation will show the folly of doing\\nso. The public today needs low-priced aeroplanes, automobiles operated with\\nfuel oil, and similar things. So other things being equal, if two men started in\\nbusiness today, one making carriages and the other making Diesel\\nautomobiles, it is probable that while the man making carriages might make a\\nbare living out of his business, he would never make any “big” money. He\\nmight be every bit as smart, even a better business man, but society is not\\nwilling to exchange money for better horse-drawn carriages. But it will for\\nautomobiles which will run one hundred miles to the gallon of crude oil!The First Step in Making Money\\nIt is easier to make money in some localities than in others. There is, for\\nexample, the Ogden hardware merchant who became rich selling shovels\\nduring the California gold rush. He was quick to see that with people pouring\\ninto the West digging everywhere for gold, they would need a lot of shovels.\\nSo he wrote back east and bought all the shovels he could get. It was no trick\\nto sell them. All he had to do was to advertise that he had shovels to sell, and\\nthe prospectors took them away from him at fancy prices. That kind of\\nmerchandising does not require any skill. Neither does it require any\\nknowledge of business principles. But the gold rush is over. The West has\\nbeen settled. To be successful in business today you need more than a stock\\nof merchandise. You have to know how to sell goods at a profit. Nine out of\\nevery ten men who start in business today fail because they cannot measure\\nup to those requirements—especially the last part of the formula.\\nSo the first step in starting a business of your own is to know something\\nabout it. You need not know all about it. But you must know something about\\nit. Fortunately much of the knowledge you need may be found in books and\\ntrade periodicals. The manufacturers of the equipment which you will need to\\nget started are usually able to furnish you with essential information. The\\nfederal and state governments have publications of value to you. This is all\\nexperience which you can buy very inexpensively, yet it is experience that\\nhas cost others much time and money. So read everything published about the\\nbusiness you intend to start, to get the combined experience of others, and\\nbegin your plans where they left off.\\nYou will find many people who will laugh at the idea of learning how to\\nmake money in books. They will tell you that business success depends upon\\ninherent trading ability and action. They will cite men who never read a book\\nin their lives and still made lots of money in business. Do not be influenced\\nby these views. No man ever started in business for himself, who did not\\nshort-cut the time it took him to become established, by reading about what\\nothers had done. When you read a book about business it is just as though\\nyou were invited into the home of the author and sat down with him and\\ntalked over your problems. Only those who think they know all there is to beknown—and more besides—consider such an exchange of ideas foolish.\\nWhy spend hundreds of dollars to find out that a business idea or plan will\\nnot work, when another who has tried the plan tells you in a book or a\\nmagazine article exactly why it is not a good idea? At the end of this volume\\nyou will find references to books, pamphlets and magazines which may be\\nconsulted for further information on some business problem. Consult those\\nreferences. They may save you much grief and loss.\\nBut understand this: Reading alone won’t enable you to succeed in business.\\nThe best idea ever conceived for making money is utterly worthless until\\nsomebody puts it to work. You, no doubt, know many brilliant men, fellows\\nwith more ideas for making money than a dog has fleas, yet who never get\\nenough money together to buy a second-hand automobile. What is wrong\\nwith them? They are probably like the inventor who never stops inventing\\nlong enough to make and sell his invention. One good idea, at work making\\nmoney, is worth a thousand ideas just buzzing around in the head of the\\nsmartest man in America.\\nHow to Begin Making Money\\nThe way to begin making money, is to begin. That may sound foolish. But\\nthe hundreds of thousands of people in this country who would like to make a\\nlot of money are not making it because they are waiting for this, that, or the\\nother thing to happen. Some are waiting for business to get better. Others are\\nwaiting for the right moment. For the most part, however, they are waiting\\nfor no reason in the world except that it is easier to put off until tomorrow\\nthose things which should be done today. Business is a game of “put and\\ntake”—you can’t “take out” until you “put in.”\\nPeople often put off starting in business for themselves because they cannot\\nsee clearly ahead. So they go to friends for advice. It is characteristic of\\npeople, when advising friends, to be super-conservative. Benjamin Franklin,\\nyou will remember, asked his friends what they thought of his chance to\\nsucceed in publishing a newspaper in Philadelphia. Without exception they\\nadvised against it on the grounds that there were already too many\\nnewspapers. They did not take into consideration Franklin’s ability nor hiscapacity to succeed. Had they stopped to analyze the situation they would\\nhave advised him to go ahead by all means. The fact that there were so many\\nnewspapers made the opportunity for a better newspaper that much greater!\\nAs a rule most of the advice to those contemplating a business venture is\\n“don’t.” If you ask the advice of enough people you are almost sure to end up\\nby doing nothing.\\nThe only person really qualified to advise you as to what you can do is\\nyourself. You know yourself better than any one else does. You, and you\\nalone, know how determined you are to make a success of the undertaking.\\nAnd in the last analysis, about 90 per cent of being successful in business is\\nthat indefinable thing which for lack of a better name we call “guts.” If you\\nhave the “guts” to work eighteen hours a day if need be; if you have the\\n“guts” to go without pocket money in order to carry your business over the\\nrough spots; if you have the “guts” to stick when others say you are just\\nwasting your time, it is a pretty good bet that you will succeed, because that\\nis the stuff from which success is made.\\nSo do not be overconcerned with the real and imaginary difficulties that loom\\nup so large at the outset. It is not necessary that you see the harbor at the\\nother end of your course before setting sail. If you sail straight, and keep\\nmoving, you will get to your destination. But you won’t get there, or\\nanywhere, unless you start. Once you have started, most of the difficulties\\nwill give way before your enthusiasm and determination to succeed. You\\nmay end up in an entirely different business from the one you started. You\\nmay have to change your plans a number of times. But what does that matter?\\nThe all-important thing is that you have started.\\nIn the following pages you will read about hundreds of people who, like\\nyourself, had the urge to make a thousand dollars. Some earned it making\\nthings, and others selling things. Some made it quickly and others slowly. But\\nyou will find one thing true of every story in this book. Each person began\\nmaking money when he or she started. Had these people not come to a\\ndecision, and started in a business of their own, they would never have made\\nany money. Their success began with their decision to start— and so will\\nyours.Raising Money to Start a Business\\nMany a man with a good idea hesitates to start in business because he lacks\\ncapital. Capital is important, and it cannot be denied that a lack of it is one of\\nthe principal reasons for business failures. However, lack of capital need not\\nhold back a determined man. The old saying, “Where there’s a will, there’s a\\nway” still applies.\\nSometimes a money-making idea is so good that men who have capital will\\n“grub stake” you in starting your business. Many famous businesses were\\nstarted in just this way. Hires root beer is a case in point. Charles E. Hires\\ndiscovered the formula for his root beer in a farmhouse back in 1877. One\\nmorning George W. Childs, publisher of the Philadelphia Public Ledger, sat\\ndown beside Mr. Hires in a street car. “Mr. Hires,” he said, “why don’t you\\nadvertise that root beer of yours?”\\n“How can I advertise?” said Mr. Hires. “I haven’t any money.” “Advertise to\\nget money. Come around to the Ledger office and I’ll tell the bookkeeper not\\nto send you any bills for advertising until you ask for them.”\\nMr. Hires was a man of action. He knew that without venture, nothing could\\nbe gained. He accepted Mr. Child’s offer. An inch advertisement ran daily\\nfrom that time on in the Public Ledger. Slowly, but steadily, it began to pull.\\nWhen at last the profits from the advertising were sufficient to justify Mr.\\nHires’ asking for his bill, it amounted to $700. But it was a good investment.\\nIt provided the capital upon which the Hires’ business was founded. For ten\\nyears Mr. Hires plowed all his profits back into advertising, keeping only\\nenough out for a bare living for himself. He became one of the largest\\nnational advertisers in the country, with annual appropriations amounting to\\nmore than $600,000. \\nWhen a product has good repeating qualities it is sometimes possible to\\ninterest advertising agents in extending credit in order to get a business\\nstarted. If an idea offers mass advertising opportunities, some of the larger\\nagencies may accept stock in a company to offset the advertising bills.\\nAmong the well-known products now on the market which have been started\\nin this way, or which are partly owned by advertising agencies are:\\nPepsodent, Barbasol, Bon-Ami, Sapolio, Palmolive soap and Van Camp’sbeans. It will be noticed that all these products have two things in common:\\n(l) They are articles which can be sold to the general public, and (2) they\\nrepeat quickly. This last qualification is important, because generally you\\nhave to spend an amount equal to the selling price of the first purchase in\\norder to induce a person to try a product. Your only chance, therefore, of\\nmaking a profit on your advertising is the repeat factor of the article. It must\\nhave real merit, and it must have an outstanding feature that will lend itself to\\nmass exploitation, either over the air or through the press.\\nAnother way to finance a business is to organize a stock company and sell the\\nstock to friends and local business men who have surplus funds to invest. In\\nfollowing this plan, it is important to keep the voting control yourself,\\notherwise you may find that after you have the business out of the red and\\ninto a money-making position, you have been eased out of the picture.\\nIncorporate your company for twice as much as the capital required, and keep\\n51 per cent of the common or voting stock in payment for the idea or the\\npatents or whatever it is that makes the business attractive. It is better,\\nhowever, to finance a business out of its earnings, on a payas-you-go basis,\\nrather than to organize a stock company. The reasons for this are: (1) When\\nyou sell stock to others you are in effect taking them in as partners. The more\\npartners you have, the less control you will have over the policies of the\\nbusiness, and the greater the danger of dissension. (2) Minority stockholders,\\nunless they are employees, contribute little to a business beyond the initial\\ncapital. There is no reason why they should be given 49 per cent of the\\nprofits. They are entitled to a “rental” for the use of their money, and the risk\\nthey take, but in the case of a successful business, common stock dividends\\noften represent a return of several hundred per cent a year.\\nThe best way of raising the money you need to start your business, and the\\nway which in the long run will prove most profitable to you, is to find\\nsomething that you can sell. Let the commissions accumulate in a bank until\\nthe balance is enough to enable you to start in a small way. Then, by the\\nsimple process of putting back the profits into expansion, as Mr. Hires did, let\\nyour business grow. In this way you will keep control and will not have to\\nshare an unduly large proportion of its earnings with others.\\nIn this connection you will find on pages 341 to 359 of this book a number of\\nsuggested items which you can sell. If you lack the necessary capital to start\\nin business, you will probably find something described in that chapter whichcan be successfully sold in your community. By this plan you can soon\\naccumulate a thousand dollars or more for business capital.\\nThe Story of the Cash Register\\nO\\nNE of the outstanding examples of American business successes is the\\nNational Cash Register of Dayton, Ohio. It is a monument to the genius of its\\nfounder, John H. Patterson. It is a demonstration of what a man with an idea\\nand a lot of determination can accomplish, because probably no product ever\\nmade had such poor prospects for success as the cash register when it was\\nintroduced in 1884 by Patterson. That it was a useful invention no one\\ndenied, but because its value depended, so it seemed, upon the assumption\\nthat a business man’s employees were dishonest, it encountered terrific\\nopposition from retail clerks.\\nMr. Patterson’s success was due in a large measure to taking what seemed to\\nbe an insurmountable objection, and turning it into a reason for buying. Cash\\nregister salesmen were taught to turn the opposition to their advantage by\\npointing out to employers that when they put temptation in the way of their\\nclerks, they shared the guilt of any clerk who pilfered the cash drawer. They\\nbrought the issue to the proprietor of the business by pointing the accusing\\nfinger at him rather than at his clerks. And as so often happens, once the right\\napproach to the selling problem was found, the business began to grow. Even\\nto this day, the leadership which this great company enjoys in the field of\\nselling all over the world, can be traced to its policy of turning objections into\\nreasons for buying. In the words of a famous cash register salesman: “Sell\\nyour man with the weapons he hands you.”\\nJohn H. Patterson did not invent the cash register. His early experience had\\nbeen in the coal business. When he was 40 years old, he came to Dayton and\\npaid $6,500 for the controlling interest in the National Manufacturing\\nCompany, which held basic patents on a cash register. It was a crude device\\nthat functioned by punching holes in appropriate columns on a strip of paper.\\nThere seemed to be no demand for the machine at all and Patterson’sinvestment in the enterprise came to be a standing joke in the community. In\\nfact, Patterson’s old associates made so much fun of the cash register, he\\noffered the seller of the stock a bonus of $2,000 to release him from his\\ncontract. However, the seller wouldn’t take it back as a gift! When his offer\\nwas refused, Patterson made up his mind that he would go into the business\\nand make it a success.\\nPerhaps it was fortunate that Patterson knew nothing about manufacturing.\\nFor, if he had, he probably would not have touched the proposition. He would\\nhave known the difficulties of running a business without an established\\ndemand for the product. But Patterson didn’t know that “it couldn’t be done.”\\nIn December, 1884, he changed the name of the concern to the National Cash\\nRegister Company and from then until his death at 78, he “slept, ate and\\ndrank” cash registers. No one else could see a future for cash registers, but he\\nrefused to change his vision just because others could not see ahead. He\\nstarted absolutely from scratch. He had to improve the cumbersome old\\nmachine; he had to find and develop a market; he had to create advertising to\\nsell his product; he had to develop salesmen to do the selling. One might say\\nthat he invented modern salesmanship, because until that time, most selling\\nwas just order taking.\\nBy 1888, the company was beginning to make itself a power. It weathered the\\npanic of 1893 and later depressions. Patterson worked day and night against\\nalmost insurmountable odds. There were times when, had he admitted to\\nhimself the possibility of being bankrupt, he would have failed. He wouldn’t\\nrecognize failure—he could not fail. By constantly improving his product, his\\nsales methods, and his manufacturing facilities, he built up in Dayton a\\nworld-wide business that has earned millions of dollars for the Patterson\\nfamily. It shows what a man with an idea and a lot of “guts” can do.\\nHow J. C. Penney Made His First $1,000\\nJ\\nAMES C. PENNEY’S first job paid him $2.27 a month. Thirty-two years\\nlater, he was the successful head of a great business, with more than 1,000partners. He was just the average small-town country boy. Was it luck? Not\\nat all. It was a combination of enthusiasm, vision, and singleness of purpose,\\nbacked up by work. He admits that hard work alone will not bring you\\nsuccess. But hard work and a definite goal will do the trick.\\nAfter clerking for some time in a store owned by T. M. Callahan and his\\npartner, young Penney was offered a chance to become a partner in the\\nbusiness, with a new store to manage. His savings amounted to $500—not\\nnearly enough. But the two partners agreed to lend him the additional amount\\nneeded at 8 per cent. However, Penney was shrewd for his years, so he\\nshopped around and found he could borrow the amount from a bank at 6 per\\ncent.\\nThe new store opened April 14, 1902, with a capital of $6,000, a third of\\nwhich was Penney’s. It was a success from the start. The sales for the first\\nyear amounted to $28,891.11 and Penney’s share of the profit was well over\\n$1,000. While the long hours and the incessant work connected with selling\\ncustomers and buying stock may have seemed like drudgery to many, it was\\nfun to Penney. Merchandising was his field. This was the work he wanted to\\ndo, and here was the opportunity. All he needed was the energy to put the\\nbusiness over, and he had plenty of that and to spare.\\nBy 1904, J. C. Penney had opened his third store. It was about this time that\\nT. M. Callahan and his first partner decided to separate. They offered to sell\\ntheir interest in the three stores to Penney. He lacked the needed amount to\\nbuy, but such was their confidence in him they accepted his note for $30,000.\\nThe stores were known at this time as the Golden Rule stores. The unusual\\nidea J. C. Penney developed from the very beginning was the building of\\nmanagers. He built up his men and sent them out to open new stores. They in\\nturn likewise built up managers and sent them out to open still other new\\nstores. In this manner, each new store would accumulate enough capital to\\nstart the next store. Each manager who opened a new store, of course, shared\\nin the profits of that store. Thus each man selected by J. C. Penney to branch\\nout developed not only business, but men to handle the business. Here was\\nthe idea and the vision. One look at the recent sales figures, running well over$250,000,000, shows it succeeded.\\nTheStoryof“MorningGlory” TomatoJuice\\nT\\nHE Snead family of Evanston, Illinois, were up against it, just as thousands\\nof other families were in the early days of the depression. Two sons ready to\\ngo to Dartmouth and Father Snead out of a job. A less determined family\\nmight have decided that “luck” was against them and let it go at that. But the\\nSneads are not quitters.\\nSo they put their heads together and decided to get the agency for some lime\\ndrink which would mix with native gin, and see if it could not be sold to the\\nsupposedly well-to-do people along Chicago’s North Shore. But the North\\nShore did not get very much excited about the Snead family’s lime ricky.\\nOne day when the Snead spirits were down close to zero a friend on a down-\\nstate farm sent the family a case of very fine seed tomatoes. Not knowing\\nwhat better to do with them Mrs. Snead decided to convert them into tomato\\njuice. Being a good neighbor she sent a few bottles next door. The neighbors\\nmade a great fuss over it. Mrs. Snead began to wonder if perhaps her husband\\nand the boys might not be able to do better selling tomato juice the way she\\nfixed it, than they were selling lime ricky. The family went into a huddle, and\\nsince the lime ricky business was getting no better fast, they decided to try\\nMother Snead’s idea. They would call it “Morning Glory” Tomato Juice—\\nbecause it made you feel glorious, regardless of how badly you may have felt\\nthe night before.\\nThe idea of fresh, homemade tomato juice, squeezed from choice seed\\ntomatoes took hold in great shape. The Sneads charged more than the grocery\\nstores charged for tomato juice, but nobody complained. People are that way.\\nThe late Colonel Simmons used to say: “The recollection of quality remains\\nlong after the price is forgotten.” The Sneads were careful to keep the quality\\nup by making arrangements with a chap who grew tomato seeds, and\\ntherefore had the choicest varieties. They took over his entire crop andsqueezed and seeded it for him. In that way they not only obtained juice that\\nhad a superior flavor, but they got their raw materials at rock bottom prices.\\nMost important, however, it gave them a talking point—and a good talking\\npoint may mean the difference between success or failure.\\nIt was not long before the Sneads were selling all the tomato juice they could\\nmake in their kitchen factory, and had to enlarge their facilities. They rented a\\nplant alongside the railroad tracks and began to think in terms of a nation-\\nwide market. They considered all the various ways of getting distribution.\\nThey thought of selling through brokers, as so many food product\\nmanufacturers do. But the brokers told them their price was too high. They\\nthought about employing college men to sell house to house. But that idea\\nwould take too much capital. Finally, they determined to stick to the plan\\nthey had so successfully used on the North Shore.\\nSo they picked out a few social leaders in selected cities, people like the\\nDrexels and Biddles of Philadelphia, and wrote and told them about\\n“Morning Glory” Tomato Juice. The idea of serving tomato juice that was\\nmade to order had a real appeal. The orders began to come in. When Mr.\\nSnead had the endorsement of these prominent people, he went to the\\nexclusive hotels in those cities and gave them the opportunity to serve the\\nsame brand of tomato juice to their guests as the first families in the city\\nserved on their breakfast tables. With the hotels lined up, the idea of serving\\n“Morning Glory” Tomato Juice was next suggested to the railroads. The\\nPennsylvania Lines, always alert for something better, ordered a trial supply\\nand featured it on the menus of their crack trains. Next the Illinois Central fell\\nin line. In that way “Morning Glory” Tomato Juice got advertising worth\\nthousands of dollars, without the Sneads having to spend a thin dime. Before\\nlong the Snead business was going “big guns.” Today, what started out as a\\nstop-gap during the worst period of the depression is now a full-fledged\\nbusiness handling not only tomato juice but other food products as well. This\\nfamily’s hard-earned success simply proves the often overlooked truism that\\nto sell the masses, first sell the classes.\\nHow the Great Wanamaker BusinessStartedJ\\nOHN WANAMAKER had saved $1,900; his brother-in-law, Nathan Brown,\\nhad $1,600 that he was willing to risk in a partnership. “Why not begin?” said\\nWanamaker to his brother-in-law. He figured that any time was a good time\\nto begin—provided you really did begin. Business conditions were bad—the\\nnational depression, that had followed the closing of many banks in 1857,\\nhad caused unemployment, low wages, and the demoralization of\\nmanufacturers and wholesalers. Philadelphia, especially, was saturated in\\ngloom. It was 1861, the threshold of the Civil War. However, Wanamaker’s\\nmind had been made up and in February, 1861, he signed a lease that put his\\nstore into business. At 23 he was ready to assume the responsibilities of a\\nbusiness, regardless of national affairs, business conditions, or the well-meant\\nadvice of friends who had tried to discourage him from the undertaking.\\nThe store fixtures cost $375 and some clothing fabrics $739. The store\\nopened April 8, but little was sold for several days. Plenty of people passed\\nthe store, but very few entered it. Then the books showed an entry of $24.67\\nworth of “gentlemen’s collars, cuffs and neckties,” sold April 18. In the\\nmeantime the $3,500 which John Wanamaker and his brother-in-law had\\nscraped together was fast disappearing. It was just a question of how much\\nlonger they could hang on.\\nFortunately, there was an opportunity to buy the stock of a clothing\\nmanufacturer who was nervous over the effect which the war might have on\\nbusiness. Wanamaker took over the stock on thirty days’ dating and invested\\nall the money he had left—$24—in six advertisements in the Philadelphia\\nnewspapers. This happened on April 27, 1861. The advertisements did what\\nwas expected of them and the entire stock was sold in two weeks.\\nFrom then on the business grew, under the Wanamaker policy of putting\\nevery dollar that could be spared into advertising. By 1869 Wanamaker &\\nBrown were the largest retail dealers in men’s clothing in the United States.\\nWith the death of Nathan Brown, John Wanamaker & Company was\\norganized to do a general business. Today it is one of the great stores of the\\nworld, and a monument to faith in advertising.It was Wanamaker’s method to expand constantly and depend upon\\nadvertising to fill in the open spaces. What his rivals called his foolhardiness\\nwas grounded in a supreme faith in the power of advertising to build volume,\\nand the realization that volume attracted volume. When business came upon\\nany dull times or during a panic, it was always Wanamaker’s policy to\\nincrease and expand his advertising appropriation as his sales increased.\\nMrs.MacDougallTurned $38 into a Million\\nW\\nHEN Alice Foote MacDougall, of New York City, was left a widow in 1907,\\nwith three little children to support, she turned to the only work she knew\\noutside of handling her household duties—coffee blending. With a capital of\\n$38, she decided to continue her husband’s coffee-broking business. It was\\nuphill work. There was much antagonism on the street, and coffee-men in the\\nbusiness gave her just six months to last. However, she gradually became\\nestablished and the six months passed. Her little office included a borrowed\\ndesk and a second-hand chair. Not only did she have to overcome the\\nprejudices against a woman in this business, but she had to learn the simplest\\nroutine of running a business.\\nMost of Mrs. MacDougall’s accounts were clubs, hospitals and sanitariums.\\nIn the beginning, she solicited orders by mail, but she realized that she would\\nhave to make personal calls to secure more business. She mapped a radius of\\nseventy-five miles from New York and traveled this territory for several\\nyears. Two years after she started in business, she was taking in $20,000 a\\nyear. However, the profit on this amount was small as the net profit on each\\npound of coffee was only about four cents. Several years later, having built\\nup a reputation for good coffee, she opened a small coffee shop in the Grand\\nCentral Terminal, serving coffee and simple foods.\\nWithin a year from the time the shop opened, she was serving 8,000\\ncustomers a month. Gradually this shop led to a chain of six eating places,\\neach patterned after a typical European scenic spot. Mrs. MacDougall was a\\nsuccess; people flocked to her restaurants. They liked the leisurely, foreignatmosphere. Her tea rooms at this time earned as high as $1,684,000 a year.\\nThen came the depression! In 1932 like many another, Mrs. MacDougall\\nwent broke. The six restaurants went into receivership. Mrs. MacDougall,\\nhowever, had fought business difficulties before and came out ahead. She\\ndidn’t cry “stop” now. At the age of sixty-five, she made a comeback and is\\nnow the mistress of a chain of three restaurants. She is again stressing\\n“atmosphere” in her restaurants and the public is once more putting its stamp\\nof approval on her undertaking by giving these restaurants its patronage.\\nOnce more Mrs. MacDougall is on her way to making an outstanding\\nsuccess.\\nHow Otto Schnering Made His First $1,000\\nI\\nT WAS back in 1914 that Otto Y. Schnering, then twenty-one years old,\\nwent into business for himself. He had only a few dollars capital. He rented a\\nlittle office and established himself as a manufacturers’ agent, struggling\\nalong against unpredictable odds, but gaining business experience. Then\\ncame what he thought to be his real “break.” In 1916 he learned of a\\ncandymaking machine he could buy for $100. “Fortunes have been made in\\nthe candy business,” thought Schnering, so he bought the machine.\\nThe first day the machine was delivered, he put it into operation. He worked\\nuntil midnight and made a batch of what he believed to be very fine candy.\\nThe next day he took this candy and arranged with a few shopkeepers to sell\\nit for him on consignment. Then he returned to his office and made up a\\nsecond batch. He was to discover that his candy did not go well. When he\\nmade his second call, very little of it had been sold. This did not discourage\\nhim. He had embarked upon a career as a candy manufacturer. The thing to\\ndo, he figured, was to find out why his candy didn’t sell, and then make\\ncandy that would sell.\\nUnwittingly, Schnering had made a mistake that thousands of others have\\nmade when they decide to go into any kind of manufacturing business. Hemade a product that he liked, instead of one the public liked. There are\\nthousands of manufacturers today who are slowly going bankrupt because\\nthey do not follow this simple principle. They often try to force their ideas on\\nthe public, when it would be so much easier to make something that the\\npublic actually wanted.\\nIt did not take Schnering long to discover his mistake. He found out that three\\ntypes of candies sell best, namely, chocolate, caramel candies and candies\\ncontaining peanuts. He concentrated on making candies of this type, and his\\ncandies sold, though not as well as he anticipated.\\nSchnering then experimented with many kinds of candy bars. It took him\\nthree years before he had hit upon the ideal combination, one blending\\nchocolate, caramel, and peanuts, and the way the candy-public took to this\\nbar justified his experiments. He later decided to call the bar “Baby Ruth,”\\nbecause the word “baby” was familiar to every small child and adult, and\\nbecause the common name, “Ruth,” was easily pronounceable by man and\\nchild. He priced it at five cents. The success of this bar was immediate.\\nTo make a candy bar that will sell successfully does not require a\\ncandymaking machine. You can start in your own kitchen, and by following\\nthe principles outlined above, may, in a few days, work out the formula for a\\nsuccessful selling bar. Candy formulas are not subject to copyright, but the\\ntrade name of the product may be registered in the Bureau of Patents and\\nCopyrights, and its use denied to anyone but yourself. The experience of\\nevery candy manufacturer, however, would indicate that the best kinds of\\ncandy to make would be candies made from chocolate, since chocolate\\ncandies are always in demand. Kitchen-made candies, chocolate creams, dip\\ncaramels and other types sell better because they are fresher, and there is an\\nunlimited demand. A market is always ready in the local stores, where goods\\nplaced on consignment, that is, with the understanding that you will take\\nthem back if not sold within a specified time, are generally accepted.\\nchapter tWo\\nSELLING AS A BUSINESS\\nIN LOGGING camps the cook shouts, “Come and get it.” In the army the\\nbugler sounds mess call. In either case a horde of hungry men come running\\nfor their meals.\\nIn business it would be simple if a manufacturer or a merchant could bring all\\nhis customers within earshot, shout, “Come and get it” and be rushed by a\\ncrowd of customers eager to buy his product. However, as we all know,\\npeople are not that anxious to buy. They must be educated, persuaded and\\nshown how and what to buy. That is the job of salesmen and saleswomen.\\nThere is always a demand for people who can sell. Salesmanship draws its\\nmanpower from every other profession and trade. Lawyers have closed their\\nlaw books and turned to selling; some have grown rich. Surgeons have put\\naside their white coats and become salesmen. Bankers, grown tired of sitting\\non tall stools, or behind fancy desks have thrown up their jobs and turned to\\nthe more satisfying job of selling. Farmers have walked away from their\\nplows to take up salesmanship; men from machine shops, from schools,\\nchurches, stores and offices have sought the greater freedom and wider\\nopportunities for profit offered by a career in salesmanship.\\nThere are many reasons why so many men desert other types of work to take\\nup salesmanship. One of the first reasons is that you can write your own\\nticket when you become a salesman. You do not have to wait until the boss\\ngets ready to grant you a raise; a good salesman can give himself a raise in\\npay almost any time. You do not have to work long, dreary hours, Sundays\\nand holidays as the druggist, the restaurant owner or the garage employee\\nmust.\\nIn selling you are almost entirely your own boss. You set your own rate of\\npay and, like the captain of a ship at sea, you rely on your own judgment and\\nability. There are many other things that go to make selling real fun. You\\nmeet the community’s most successful, most interesting and influential\\npeople. You are in constant touch with what’s going on in the world, and you\\nare laying the foundation for success and increasingly bigger pay checks.\\nThere is almost no other man who is so thoroughly independent and secure asthe salesman who has built up the confidence and friendship of a group of\\ncustomers. A merchant may suffer fire losses that will wreck his business or\\nhe may make mistakes in buying that will shatter his profits for an entire\\nseason; a surgeon may lose the delicate skill of his hands as he grows older,\\nand the loss of one important case may send a lawyer straight down the path\\nto obscurity. A farmer may lose an entire season’s work in one heavy\\ndownpour of rain, or an overflow of the creek or river. But no fire can burn,\\nno flood destroy, no thief can steal a salesman’s stock in trade which is, as\\nyou know, the confidence and friendship of his customers.\\nOf course, there can be no doubt that most men take up selling to earn\\nmoney. But there are other satisfactions and compensations in addition to the\\nmoney earned. In 1928, a salesman almost jammed a life insurance policy\\ndown the throat of a certain New York newspaper man. The policy had an\\naccident and sickness clause which paid $100 a month in the event of illness\\nand disability. When he signed the application and paid the premium he was\\nin the best of health. Less than two years later he was in a hospital, drawing\\n$100 a month compensation. Was he grateful to that insurance salesman?\\nYou know he was. Had it not been for the salesman’s insistence, he would\\nhave suffered the loss of ten months’ earnings, and there would have been no\\nfunds to pay the heavy hospital expenses. Yet it seemed to the buyer when he\\ntook that insurance that he was doing the salesman a favor. As it turned out,\\nthe salesman did the newspaper man a favor for which he has been grateful\\never since.\\nA salesman who sold a radio receiver sometime ago to an old lady who is\\ncrippled and confined to her home said that he wondered if he had done the\\nright thing. It was an expensive set and she was dependent on a very small\\nincome. “I thought perhaps I ought not to have sold her, because it was\\nobvious that her home needed repairs and painting. But as she made the\\npayments I realized that the radio set had brought the world right to her\\narmchair. She has since told me that her radio receiver, next to her husband\\nand children, has been the greatest joy in her life.”\\nThere are literally millions of people who owe much of their happiness to\\nsalesmen. Think of the people who might never have owned a home if somereal estate salesman hadn’t “pushed them over.” Think of the thousands of\\nmothers whose lives have been made easier by some salesman who sold them\\na washing machine, a vacuum cleaner, or an ironing machine. There’s a\\npresident of a big advertising agency in New York who traces his upward rise\\nback to the time when a salesman sold him a correspondence course in\\nadvertising. Numberless cases could be pointed out where salesmen, through\\ntheir ability to educate, to persuade, and to induce people to act, have brought\\nnew prosperity, happiness and satisfaction into the lives of millions of people.\\nThat’s why it is so much fun to sell things.\\nQualifications of a Good Salesman\\nOne of the best salesmen in his field was a big, blonde fellow who was a\\ngreat handshaker and backslapper. He never missed an opportunity to make a\\nfriend or to push himself forward to meet the right people. He joined all kinds\\nof lodges and clubs. He wore pink shirts, too. He was a typical salesman—the\\nkind we read about. And he was a big success. Another topnotch salesman\\nwas a fellow who was totally unlike the first man. He never slapped any\\nbacks; he was quiet, reserved and almost diffident in his relations with\\npeople. But he could sell. When he sold an order he made a customer, and\\noften a lifelong friend.\\nThese two men are mentioned to emphasize the idea that you don’t have to be\\nan expert storyteller, a gin-hound or a great handshaker to be a good\\nsalesman. There are thousands of good salesmen who never take a drink of\\nhard liquor. There are other thousands who are quiet, unassuming, modest\\nfellows who do not feel the necessity of joining a lot of clubs or lodges, or\\npainting the town red. It isn’t even necessary for a man to have the “gift of\\ngab” to be a successful salesman. Experience has proved that more salesmen\\nhave become failures from talking too much, than from too little.\\nBecause a man doesn’t have to be a good “mixer,” in the usual sense of the\\nword, don’t jump to the conclusion that a miser can be a good salesman. But\\nthere is a whole world of middle ground between being a “mixer” and a\\nmiser. If you enjoy meeting people, if you are not scared in the event a man\\nbecomes a little gruff and grouchy with you, if you are not afraid of hardwork and study, and if you have a grim determination to succeed, you have\\nmost of the important qualifications of a good salesman.\\nOf course, if you are imaginative, can see the inherent value in a proposition\\nquickly, if you have the knack of explaining values in interesting and forceful\\nterms, if you have any natural qualities of leadership—so much the better.\\nBut, important as these qualities may be, many men who have them in only\\nthe smallest degree succeed in selling.\\nYou may ask what is meant by “natural qualities of leadership.” Were you\\never the captain of a sandlot or high school baseball team? Are you invariably\\nappointed to some office in any little group, lodge, association, or club you\\njoin? Do people gravitate toward you and go out of their way to see you or\\nplease you? If these things are true, you are a natural leader and there is no\\nbetter way to capitalize your inherent abilities than in a career as a salesman.\\nBut if you like to be alone, if you would rather read about a football game\\nthan go to one and yell your head off, if you would rather sit by the fire of a\\nwinter’s night and read a good book than go to a party, perhaps you had\\nbetter not try selling—unless you are willing to fight hard to overcome your\\nnatural inclinations.\\nTo add one word of caution: Don’t pay too much attention to what your\\nfriends tell you. Many a potentially good salesman has been ruined by the\\nwell-meant, but mistaken, advice of wives, friends, mothers, or\\nschoolteachers. After all, it is up to each man to decide for himself what he\\nwants to do, whether it is running a retail store, building up a manufacturing\\nbusiness, farming, selling or anything else. You know in your own mind\\nwhether you want to sell or not. Once you have made up your mind, go\\nahead. If you are the sort of person who is constantly swayed back and forth\\nin your opinions and your desires by the advice of friends, then perhaps you\\nhad better not try to be a salesman.\\nGetting the Name on the Order Blank\\nWhen you begin to sell you are almost sure to find nearly everyone will\\npromise you some business. You will be told, “I will keep you in mind,” or “Iwill let you know when I need anything.” People really mean these\\npleasantries when they say them to you, but they seldom bother to remember\\nthem after a salesman is out of sight. You must learn, and learn quickly, too,\\nthat a promised order pays no commissions, turns no factory wheels.\\nThe ability to close sales without a long, drawn-out series of “call backs” is\\nthe greatest asset a salesman can have. Without this ability you are just a\\nsolicitor, not a salesman. There’s an old saying, “Anybody can solicit\\nbusiness, but it takes a salesman to close orders.”\\nThe first thing to remember in closing a sale is that most people need a little\\npushing to bring them to a decision. The natural inclination of every prospect\\nis to put off buying as long as possible. Even a woman, a few days before\\nEaster, will want to put off buying a hat or a new outfit, until she has seen\\nwhat every store in town has to offer. Yet she wants that new hat or dress as\\nbadly as she ever wanted anything. She’d be heartbroken if she knew she\\ncouldn’t have it. But she wants to wait, wait, wait and see if she can’t find\\nsomething she likes a little better.\\nKeeping this human trait uppermost in your minds, as salesmen, you can\\nunderstand the necessity of persistence and pressure in helping people to\\nmake up their minds. Take the case of a man buying a new automobile. He\\nmay have decided to buy a Ford, a Chevrolet or a Plymouth. But which one?\\nAll three cars are presented to him in the most favorable manner. He is a bit\\nconfused. Each car has certain special features which appeal to him. The\\nsalesman’s job is to bring him to the point of deciding. There are definite\\nmethods of doing this. For example, one salesman may say: “Mr. Prospect, if\\nyou will just check your preferences as to color, tires, and body style, I’ll put\\nyour order through, so you can drive this car next Sunday.”\\nSee how this salesman has simplified the prospect’s problem of making a\\ndecision. See how much better this attempt at closing is, than: “Think it over\\nand let me know what kind of tires and wheels you want.” The washing\\nmachine salesman may say, “Mrs. Jones, if you will sign this memorandum\\nyou can have this machine in your basement by Monday, and finish your\\nwashing long before noon, leaving you free from worry and work all Mondayafternoon.”\\nIn closing an order make everything as simple as possible, and get the\\nprospect to take some first, easy steps toward signing. A typewriter salesman\\nhad the president of a large company convinced that his machine was right.\\nBut there were some twenty-five old machines to be listed for tradein and a\\ncontract to be drawn. The salesman saw that the president, who was\\naccustomed to “okaying” memoranda which had been prepared for him, was\\nbusy. Had he waited for the president to ask someone to list all the old\\ntypewriters to be traded in and to draw up the contract, he would never have\\nobtained the order.\\nThe salesman went out of the president’s office, tore off a sheet of wrapping\\npaper. On it he listed the serial numbers of all machines which were to be\\ntraded in. Under the list he wrote, “$21 allowance on these machines.” Back\\ninto the president’s office went the salesman. He showed the president the\\nmemorandum and said, “Just okay this and I will have your purchasing agent\\nprepare the order.” The president scribbled his initials and his okay in a jiffy.\\nLater the salesman went to the purchasing agent who prepared a formal\\npurchase order for the twenty-five new typewriters. The salesman had made\\nthe job of buying as simple as possible.\\nAt the first sign of agreement on the part of the prospect, the wise salesman\\n“asks for the order.” If he can’t close at this point, he goes right on\\nexplaining, even in some cases, repeating things he has said before. Then he\\nasks for the order again. More men make the mistake of asking for the order\\ntoo late than too soon. Remember this point when selling—ask for the order\\nfive times before you give up. Very often a prospect will spar and feint by\\nsaying he will check his stock and let you know. Or he will tell you that he\\nwill find out what color, or what size, or what quantity is needed. Here is\\nwhere the salesman shows whether he is really an order getter, or just a\\nsolicitor. If he is really a salesman he’ll say, “That’s fine, Mr. Prospect, just\\nokay this order with the color (or size or quantity) left blank and I will have\\nyour clerk (assistant bookkeeper, or secretary) fill in the details.”\\nNot long before this was written a salesman was trying to sell a landlord aKelvinator electric refrigerator. Two other refrigerator salesmen were after\\nthe order too. The landlord couldn’t make up his mind, so he said he would\\ntalk to the tenant and find out what make the tenant preferred. The Kelvinator\\nsalesman went straight to the tenant and explained all the good points of\\nKelvinators. The other two salesmen waited a day or two and then came\\nback. “Sorry, but I bought a Kelvinator,” said the landlord when they\\napproached him. The Kelvinator salesman had “cinched” the order by seeing\\nthe tenant and then going right back to the landlord and saying, “Your tenant\\nwill be delighted with a Kelvinator, because I have just seen him and told him\\nall about it.”\\nDeciding What to Sell\\nWhat do you want to sell? Don’t make the mistake of thinking, “I would sell\\nanything if I had the chance.” The first step in going into sales work is to\\ndecide what you want to sell, and what you think you can sell. You might do\\na splendid job of selling electric ranges, yet fail miserably in selling electric\\nmotors. Or vice versa. You could conceivably make a big success selling life\\ninsurance and fail completely to sell accounting machines. Your own\\nprevious experience, your interests, hobbies, education, and background, all\\nshould govern the selection of something you like to sell. If you like the feel\\nand touch of materials; if you have an eye for style, line, color; if you are a\\nnatural trader who loves to see money changing hands, by all means get into\\nselling something that is sold over the counter in retail stores. But if you are\\nthe kind of fellow who thinks that a retail merchant is just a “shopkeeper,”\\nand you can’t get excited about a piece of merchandise and the possible profit\\nit carries, then forget about selling to retailers.\\nDo you like automobiles? Are you interested in all the new models that come\\nout from year to year? This interest may be turned into profit by selling\\nautomobiles. Are you of a mechanical turn of mind? There are a thousand\\nmechanical devices to sell. And so on through the long gamut of everything\\nthat is made. There are a thousand things you could sell. But find the one\\nthing you want to sell, and you’ve made your first step toward a career in\\nselling.In the following portion of this chapter you will read how other people who,\\nlike yourself, had a real desire to sell, satisfied their desire and made good\\nmoney to boot. You will notice that in nearly every instance the adventure\\nproved successful because the product offered for sale rendered a definite\\nservice to the buyer. It is not enough that you are enthusiastic about selling a\\nproduct or service; it must be something for which a need exists. When you\\nare searching for something to sell, make sure that it not only appeals to you,\\nbut that it will appeal to those to whom you must sell it. In this connection\\nyou will find in the supplement in the back of this book a list of products,\\nwhich offer such opportunities. From this list you can make a selection with\\nevery assurance that the product is salable.\\nEvery Woman Is a Hosiery Prospect\\nL\\nUCILE ANTHONY , forced to shift for herself and her six-month-old baby\\nwhen her husband had deserted her, turned to selling silk hosiery. The\\nfascination beautiful silk hose held for her was, she admitted, almost an\\nobsession. She points out that her chief reason for selling connection with a\\nhosiery manufacturer was to enable her to go from home to home and meet\\npeople.\\n“Besides a genuine love for sheer silken hose, I had practically no other\\nenthusiasm,” Lucile explained. “I received samples of six different colored\\nhose in a light folding case from the company, and was so eager to tell my\\nfriends about the hose that my first calls didn’t seem like selling at all. I\\nvisited friends first. Most of them gave me orders in units of three or more\\npairs. But I soon ran out of friends, for you know no matter how many people\\nyou’re acquainted with, sooner or later you’ve told the story to everyone. So\\nwhen I had seen every friend I had, I started selling to strangers. This proved\\nmore difficult than I expected. When the women came to the door, they\\ndidn’t expect to see a saleswoman and were not in the mood for buying.\\nMany scowled. None asked me in, as my friends had done, and I thought\\nwhile making my initial call on strangers that the world was hard and cruel.In three days I made only two sales. Something was decidedly wrong.\\n“I realized that I was not using a scientific approach when calling on these\\nwomen—I was saying the first thing that came to my mind. Since I wasn’t\\ngetting anywhere, I thought something was wrong with my product. Then,\\nlike many others, I blamed my inability to make sales on the kind of work I\\nwas doing. Indeed, I was so sure it was because I was doing house-to-house\\nselling that housewives wouldn’t give consideration, I was annoyed and\\nupset. Yet the idea of selling hose, of handling them, of talking about them to\\neverybody was strong enough to overcome the impulse to quit. Out of my\\nfirst impressions about selling, there emerged a few clear ideas on\\nsalesmanship. I began to realize that my trouble was the way I went about\\nmaking sales; that it wasn’t exactly what I said at the door that mattered, so\\nmuch as the way I said it. There are no magic words that admit one to homes.\\n“Presently I was aware of being more successful getting in when I kept on\\ntalking. Women who opened the door to tell me they wouldn’t buy anything,\\nusually waited until I made a move to leave before closing the door. So I\\nbegan to use strategy. Standing several feet from the door, at the edge of the\\nporch, I would talk loudly. I would tell the woman about the beautiful hosiery\\nI carried.\\n“ ‘No. Nothing today,’ was the usual answer. ‘But if you would only give me\\na minute—.’\\n“ ‘I’m busy. Not today.’\\n“ ‘It won’t take any time at all. Won’t you let me come in?’\\n“ ‘I have no money. Not today.’\\n“ ‘But if you once saw them, Mrs. Smith, I know—’\\n“ ‘Call back again next week. I won’t buy a thing today.’\\n“ ‘But I’m not asking you to buy, won’t you even take a moment to look?’\\n“ ‘Not today. I’m sorry. I’m very busy.’\\n“ ‘I understand you’re very busy, Mrs. Smith. I really won’t take up any time\\nat all. Won’t you let me in?’\\n“After some moments of this type of conversation, the housewife would\\ninvite me inside. That gave me a chance to do some real selling. My\\nenthusiasm for silk hosiery usually proved infectious and the woman wouldlet me have an order.”\\nMrs. Anthony’s method of getting past the door is used by many successful\\nsalespeople with good results. She makes an average of forty-five calls daily,\\nand during her second six-month period of selling for this company earned\\ncommissions which totaled eleven hundred and seven dollars. Her biggest\\nday’s income came just before commencement exercises at the University of\\nChicago, when she called on two sorority houses and sold fifty-six pairs of\\nhosiery in two group demonstrations. Her commission is fifty cents a pair,\\ncollected as a deposit from the prospect at the time the order is given. The\\nbalance due the company is collected C.O.D. when shipment is made.\\nThis type of work is ideal for women who are anxious to turn their spare time\\ninto money. Working hours may be suited to your own convenience and no\\ninvestment is needed to start in this remunerative business.\\nOvercomingPriceObjections\\nI\\nT IS typical of merchants and others engaged in smaller businesses to feel\\nthey cannot afford most of the things they would like to have. It seems to be a\\nsort of complex with them. But as Henry Ford once said: “Every man feels\\nmuch poorer than he really is.” This is a good point to remember when\\nselling to storekeepers. You have to anticipate this objection, by presenting\\nwhat you may be selling in a way that will turn the price into a reason for\\nbuying. Very often this “can’t afford it” feeling can be made the key point in\\na sales presentation and capitalized to advantage. This is especially true if\\nyou are fortunate enough to be selling a product which looks “expensive” but\\nwhich actually costs much less than the prospect imagines he will have to pay\\nfor it.\\nTake the case of George Conrad, for example. He has developed a surefire\\nplan of selling slicing machines around this very idea. When he enters a store\\nhe doesn’t say a word, but lays a big broadside on the merchant’s counter\\nshowing a colorful illustration of the slicing machine he is selling. He leaves\\nthe machine outside in his car.“What do you think of that?” he asks his prospect, who in this case is the\\nproprietor of a small meat market.\\n“It looks good,” the butcher replies after looking at the colored advertisement\\nfor several minutes. “But I can’t afford an expensive slicing machine such as\\nthat. It costs too much.”\\n“But you need one, don’t you?”\\n“Yes, but I’m not doing very much business and can’t afford to lay out a lot\\nof money for a slicing machine.”\\nConrad smiles, goes out to his car, brings in a sample machine, hooks it up\\nbehind the counter, and requests the butcher (who is still protesting that he\\ncan’t afford it) to try the machine.\\n“Like it?” Conrad asks after a few minutes. “Certainly, but I simply can’t pay\\n. . .”\\n“I understand. This machine is a low-priced slicer, however, and looks and\\nworks just like the expensive ones. Guaranteed too. How much could you\\nafford to pay in cash for a slicer?”\\nThe butcher shakes his head. “The way business is, I couldn’t go over $10.”\\n“Well, if you can pay that much get out your money,” is Conrad’s standard\\nreply. “This slicer will cost you only $7.50.”\\nThis is typical of the interviews Conrad has with grocers, butchers, and\\nproprietors of lunchrooms, restaurants, delicatessens and taverns when he\\ncalls with his hand-slicing machine. It is this approach which is responsible\\nfor his averaging $75 a week for the past two years.\\n“This slicer looks like an expensive machine that costs a lot of money,”\\ndeclares Conrad. “It is a sturdy, rotary type slicer with a stainless steel blade\\nadjustable to any thickness, so that it will slice ham as thin as tissue paper, or\\nbread any thickness you desire. Before this came out, though, the average\\ngrocer and delicatessen proprietor had to pay around $150 for a slicing\\nmachine. Naturally, when they see this one, which looks every bit as good as\\nthe expensive machine and is quite as satisfactory, it is hard for them to\\nbelieve it’s not an expensive outfit. I let them think that. I let them build up as\\nmuch resistance as they want toward paying a big price. Then, when I’ve\\nfinally got them to make a demonstration and admit the machine is good, I\\ncrash this opposition with the low-price offer. And I seldom lose a sale.”\\nTo those who like to sell to stores, a good slicing machine offers a real\\nmoney-making opportunity. Conrad’s commission on each sale is twodollars, and he has sold as high as eighty machines in one week. His average\\nweek, however, is about thirty-seven slicers.\\nHow to Sell “Tailored-to-Measure” Suits\\nI\\nN THREE months, John Gleason “cleaned up” well over a thousand dollars\\nfrom the sale of men’s tailored-to-measure suits. But Gleason had been\\nmaking little or no profit from his selling activity in the previous months.\\nIndeed, as he himself put it, he was just another doorbell pusher. He had\\ndifficulty overcoming the objections raised by prospects. He had trouble\\nfinding men who were in a position to buy suits. And he experienced\\ndisappointment when getting in to see prospects. As a salesman, Gleason\\nadmits he wasn’t so “hot.”\\nTo believe that he suddenly turned over a new leaf would be too much. He\\ndidn’t. He did change some of his selling methods, however, and taught\\nhimself to be at ease with people. It was due to his willingness to let an older\\nhand show the way, though, which enabled Gleason to climb into the big\\nmoney-making class.\\n“Living in the apartment above was a salesman I greatly admired,” explained\\nGleason. “This fellow was a polished, suave chap, who had been selling for\\nyears. When I got pretty well acquainted with him, I asked him for pointers\\non selling. It was difficult for me to understand all the points he made. At\\nfirst I thought they were only theories so I did not take them seriously. I grew\\nmore and more discouraged. I mentioned this to him. ‘I’m awfully sorry,’ he\\nsaid, ‘I’d like to do something to help you.’ ‘You can if you wish,’ I\\nanswered quickly. ‘There’s a lot that you could teach me, if you would make\\na call or two with me.’ He agreed to do so.\\n“It was arranged to call on some prospects together. I made the first interview\\nbut didn’t get very far. It was a call upon a doctor who got rid of me in a\\nhurry. Outside the office, on the way to the next call, my friend was very\\nthoughtful and made no comment. When I lost the second sale, he said softly:‘Let’s drop down to the lunchroom and talk this over. You’ve made an effort\\nto make two sales, and have avoided letting anyone know what you’re trying\\nto sell.’ He made no further comment on the matter until we faced each other\\nacross a table in the lunchroom. Then he pointed out an obvious error in my\\ntactics. ‘When you got in to see those fellows, they knew you came to sell\\nsomething. Why do you talk about representing a large responsible house\\nselling high quality merchandise? Why not try to sell them a suit? These men\\nare busy. They know what they want, when they see it. Cut the introduction\\nand get down to business.’\\n“‘You’ve got to begin, you know,’ I said in defense.\\n“‘Sure you do,’ he retorted. ‘That’s my point. Begin at once. When we go to\\nsee your next prospect, I’ll give you an idea of what I mean.’\\n“Half an hour later, we entered the office of a real estate dealer. ‘I’m offering\\nsome of the greatest suit bargains you ever saw,’ said my friend, but the\\nrealtor shook his head. ‘That’s a fine looking suit you’re wearing. Isn’t it one\\nof our twenty-two fifty line?’\\n“‘Nope,’ replied the realtor, ‘I bought this in a store.’\\n“My friend moved over to the prospect and closely examined the man’s coat.\\n‘Hmm,’ he murmured, ‘that is certainly a fine piece of goods, isn’t it,\\nGleason?’\\n“I stepped up and admired it. The realtor smiled. ‘Let me show you the same\\ngoods here—’ and my friend held out his hand as a sign for me to show a\\nsample. I opened my case and brought out a sample swatch. Quickly this was\\nplaced in the prospect’s hand. A moment later he was fingering it.\\n“‘Do you like your sleeves that short? They seem a trifle short to me,’ my\\nfriend said critically.\\n“The prospect admitted the sleeves were a little short. I got my friend’s idea\\nat once. Quickly I measured the prospect’s sleeve and marked it on the order\\nblank. Then I went through the entire measuring series myself.\\n“After taking this prospect’s measure, I asked him if he wanted us to have a\\nsuit made up for him. He hesitated, but my friend saved the situation.\\n“‘Here’s a fabric that certainly will make up beautifully, and it’ll look fine on\\nyou.’ The prospect was guided back to a consideration of fabrics once more.\\nFinally his choice was narrowed down to two fabrics and soon the sale wasclosed.\\n“My friend pointed out the following errors in the method I had been using:\\n(1) My opening arguments were not natural or interesting. (2) I did not tie up\\nthe prospect with the idea of owning another suit. (3) I did not show how\\ngood my suits were in comparison with those being worn. (4) I did not\\npicture the prospect wearing the suit. (5) I was voiding all the previous\\ninterview by a negative suggestion at the close, when I should be writing the\\norder.\\n“Closely following the tactics used by my friend brought results. I now sell\\nan average of four suits daily, netting commissions of $12.95 a day which is\\nbetter than $3,000 a year!”\\nGleason calls on business men and workers in shop and office; he does not\\nwaste time on men who are not working. Calling at the factory entrances of\\nplants about lunch time enables him to make a demonstration to a group of\\nmen and arrange evening appointments at the homes of those interested. He\\nsells from a sample. The order blank is so arranged that anyone can easily\\nfollow the directions for taking the accurate measure for a suit. The deposit,\\nmade by the prospect at the time the order is taken, is the salesman’s\\ncommission. The balance is collected C.O.D. by the manufacturer when the\\nshipment is made.\\nTo sell clothing successfully does not require selling experience of any\\nnature. It does require a sales plan and some initiative in working the plan.\\nMany made-to-measure tailoring companies, selling their suits through direct\\nsalesmen to the wearer, supply detailed instructions for salesmen.\\nThe Right and Wrong Way to Sell NurseryStock\\nW\\nILLIAM WERNER got his first thousand dollars from trees. There were\\nfinancial worries in the Werner household, and the need of additional cash\\nled Werner, who clerked in a men’s furnishing store, to sell nursery stock in\\nhis spare time.\\n“One day,” he said, “I happened to mention my nursery line to a teller in thebank. He was building a new home and wanted a few trees and shrubs. But he\\ncooled off when I said that our stock was small and that it took some years\\nfor the trees to grow big. ‘What will they look like then?’ he asked. I tried to\\nexplain and he said he would think it over. When I called back, he was still in\\ndoubt whether to buy from me or from a local greenhouse. ‘The greenhouse\\nman has such a beautiful story about how nice and shady a fir tree would be\\nin one year that he has almost sold my wife. But if you want to tell your story\\nto her, it’s all right with me.’\\n“When I called at the teller’s home, I asked his wife to step into the yard and\\nlook at the old brick wall of the apartment house they were living in. Then I\\ntried to picture to her how much more attractive that bare wall would be with\\nEnglish ivy clinging to it, and the foot of the wall gay with flowers. This\\nseemed to make an impression on her. We talked a lot about the different\\nkinds of bushes and shrubs. She preferred lilacs, it developed, and said she\\nalways liked the scent of the lilacs in the air. I kept telling her about the way\\nthe place would look when it was finished and the shrubs and bushes planted\\nand fully grown.\\n“I got an order for $207 before I left, but it took me from two that Sunday\\nafternoon until six-thirty to get it. My commission was $29. Elated, I wrote\\nthe firm about the way I made this sale, and got back a letter containing some\\nvery good advice. This letter complimented me highly, and said: ‘Always\\nremember that when people buy nursery stock, they expect definite results.\\nIt’s results they want, not a tree a foot high. Sell them results.’ I’ve thought\\nabout that many times since. The other day, when I was talking to a farmer\\nabout buying 100 apple trees of a new variety, I knew he wanted to know\\nhow many apples the trees would bear. I pictured a whole orchard for him,\\nwith fruit hanging on the trees. Of course, he realized as well as I did that the\\ntrees would be tiny when he planted them, but he knew they would grow big\\nwith the passing of time, and that eventually they would bear fruit. He wanted\\nto see a vision of results, and I helped him see the vision.\\n“Merely to quote prices on berry bushes, fruit trees, shrubs and other nursery\\nstock would never get an order for me. Most people, I’ve discovered, are\\ntotally lacking in imagination. They are able to picture a thing only when it isshown to them. It is up to me to do their imagining for them. Orders vary in\\nsize, and the commission varies greatly, of course. I sell every kind of shrub,\\nand sell in quantities of from one tree for the backyard of a city dweller to a\\nwhole orchard of perhaps a thousand. The first six weeks after I sold that\\nbanker’s wife, I earned commissions well over $1,200.”\\nWerner, after this success, left his regular position and devoted all his time to\\nselling nursery stock. He makes many calls, but succeeds in interviewing\\nonly seven prospects in an average day. The commission earned on each sale\\nhe has made since he started selling nursery stock is $9.10 an order. He\\naverages two orders daily. His commissions are paid to him weekly, as orders\\nare verified, this being the nursery’s established policy. This policy does not\\napply to all nurseries. Some concerns insist the salesman collect his\\ncommission in the form of a deposit, at the time the order is given. Prospects\\nare found everywhere, in small towns and big cities, suburbs, and rural\\ndistricts. Some nursery salesmen make a practice of calling at regular\\nintervals upon county school boards, playgrounds, churches and like places,\\nwhere there is frequent demand to replenish or replace trees and shrubs. No\\nmoney is needed to start in this profitable field.\\nSelling Frocks Brings Back Prosperity\\nW\\nHEN S. P. Liest lost his job, his family became panicky. They had no\\nsavings, and the prospect of Liest getting another job quickly was remote.\\nBut his plucky wife did not despair. She had read about a manufacturer of\\nwomen’s frocks who appointed agents to sell his products. She wrote to him\\nasking for a local agency, and presently received a number of style cards and\\na selling kit, with some practical suggestions for getting started. The plan was\\nto call upon housewives in their homes. Determined to make money the first\\nday, Mrs. Liest started out.\\n“I was lucky on my first call,” Mrs. Liest declared. “When I approached the\\ndoor I felt the porch would open up and swallow me, I was so frightened.\\nWhen the prospect opened the door and smiled good morning, I couldn’t talk,and I believe if I hadn’t been so desperate for money, I might have quit right\\nthere. This prospect was very gracious, however. She seemed to feel sorry for\\nme. She asked me to step inside, and by degrees I recovered from my stage\\nfright. Then I started to talk about the frocks, and the dresses I was selling\\njust as though I were visiting a friend. We talked styles and colors and\\nfashions. I showed her the style cards, pointing out that they featured the\\nlatest Parisian fashions, and that she had probably seen similar designs in a\\ncurrent woman’s magazine. We got the magazine and compared the style\\nfeatures of my frocks with those illustrated in the publication, and I soon\\nforgot I came to get that woman’s order, having become so absorbed in\\ntalking about clothes. When she presently told me that she would take each\\none of three numbers the manufacturer was pushing, I was not a little\\nsurprised. My commission, $4.30, was the exact amount of the deposit\\nrequired, the balance being collected by the manufacturer C.O.D. I was\\nelated. I didn’t make another call that day. I hurried home, stopping at the\\ngrocery on the way to get things for dinner, and entered the house loaded\\nwith bags of groceries.”\\nMrs. Liest was not so successful the next day, however. She made several\\ncalls, but failed to get an order. Analyzing that day’s selling effort made her\\nwonder why it had seemed so easy to make her first sale. “I couldn’t help\\nbelieving that my first sale was prompted by the charity and kindness of my\\nfirst prospect,” Mrs. Liest pointed out, “and that was disappointing, but the\\nmore I thought about it, the more inclined I was to change this view. I saw\\nafter some time, that when I started out I didn’t make a conscious effort to get\\nan order. I talked dresses and dress styles. I was just one woman talking to\\nanother woman about clothes. This touch, present in the first interview, was\\nlost in those that followed, and I was making a stilted, unnatural effort to\\nbuild interest. I changed my method. Now when I call to see a woman about\\nfrocks, I talk as most women would talk about clothes. I get my selling points\\nover in this way, and it’s natural. I make a point to wear my sample, and the\\nprospect then can visualize the way it hangs and looks when being worn. I\\nask the prospect to note the depth of the hems, the French seams, the latest\\nstyle features, and the washable guarantee that is sewn into each frock. In this\\nway I build the prospect’s interest to the buying point.”During her first nine months, Mrs. Liest made a profit well over $1,000 from\\nfrock sales. Commenting on this, she said: “All I do is talk woman to woman\\nabout clothes.” She was not required to invest in a sample kit or style cards.\\nHer entire selling outfit was furnished by the manufacturer. She makes an\\naverage of thirty calls a day, and sells not less than four frocks daily, on\\nwhich her commissions total $5.17. Mrs. Liest has had days when she sold as\\nmany as fifteen frocks, and more than one day she has sold from ten to\\nthirteen. She has found that the best time for calling upon housewives is\\nbetween nine-thirty in the morning and three-thirty in the afternoon.\\nBecause women like to talk about clothes, they willingly admit the\\nrepresentatives of dress and frock manufacturers who call at their door. You\\nmay readily become a representative for such a manufacturer who sells on the\\nC.O.D. plan. The deposit, or initial payment, made at the time the order is\\ntaken, is retained by the salesperson as the commission on the sale. The\\nbalance is collected C.O.D. when the parcel post shipment is made.\\nA Good Way to Sell Radios\\nE\\nNTERING the lobby of a small hotel frequented by salesmen and guests\\nwho resided there permanently, James Winton placed a radio on the clerk’s\\ndesk and said to him: “May I connect this to a light socket? No ground, no\\naerial is necessary.”\\nThe clerk obligingly permitted Winton to connect the radio and several men\\nin the lobby gathered around him out of idle curiosity. In a few moments a\\nlocal station was tuned in and music floated over the heads of this group,\\nacross the lobby. For some minutes Winton contented himself with a\\ndemonstration of the radio, moving its volume control from a whisper to a\\nloud clear tone, without saying a word. When he felt that he had secured the\\nundivided attention of his audience, he took a punch board from his brief\\ncase, and addressed the men in the lobby.\\n“This radio retails for twenty-nine fifty,” said Winton.“It is one of the best small sets you can buy. The fellow who punches the\\nright number gets it.” He extended the board to one of the men, and in less\\nthan thirty minutes, the board, passed from one to another, was completely\\npunched out. A guest in one of the rooms on the third floor started away with\\nthe radio, smiling. Winton, pocketing the proceeds, suggested to the clerk that\\nhe take a punch board. “You keep 25 per cent of what you take in on the\\nboard,” said Winton, “and the radio will be free.” The clerk agreed, so\\nWinton left a board with him and then went on to his next call.\\n“I made twenty dollars profit on that first punch board in the hotel,” said\\nWinton. “On the board left with the clerk, I made five dollars. I delivered the\\nradio when the board was punched out. The radios were sold to me at the\\nusual discount to dealers by the manufacturer, so I had a nice profit from\\nthose two boards. But small hotels are not the only places where I sell radios.\\nYou’d be surprised at the number of barber shops, cigar stores, billiard halls,\\nand other places of this nature where you can put in these radios and do a\\nnice business. Some of the more popular barber shops, lunchrooms, and\\nrecreation parlors use as many as three boards weekly. I had a little difficulty\\ngetting the hang of lining them up at first though. I thought it was only\\nnecessary to sell the proprietor or a clerk. I was fooled. You have to show\\nthem how to make money on the board. That’s why I connect the radio first.\\nNo one is interested in a demonstration that doesn’t demonstrate. They want\\nto hear the radio as well as look at it. My present method proves the money-\\nmaking possibilities to the clerk and shows the crowd just how good the radio\\nis.”\\nWinton pointed out that trying to talk up the sale isn’t effective with him. He\\nbuys his radios from a wholesale company, specializing in this type of radio\\ndistribution, and during his first four months his profits were well over a\\nthousand dollars. He builds up his business by establishing an “agent” in a\\nbarber shop, pool room, or tavern, in the manner described above. Each\\nagent, so appointed, uses between three and six boards monthly. He pays for\\nthe boards and the radios he uses when delivered by the wholesaler, and the\\ncost of the first radio is the extent of his original investment. This amounts to\\ntwelve dollars.It is possible for anyone who will really work to make a good profit\\nsupplying the hotels, restaurants, lunchrooms, cigar stores, drug stores, barber\\nshops, and billiard halls with this sales plan. By making about twenty calls on\\nprospects daily, Winton averages over nineteen dollars a day when he is\\nworking.\\nA Storeless Shoe Business\\nW\\nHEN J. W. Hawkins, of Cleveland, Ohio, who had been representing a\\nwholesale shoe company for twenty years, had his territory taken away from\\nhim, he decided to turn his knowledge of the shoe business to his own\\nadvantage. He made a connection selling shoes direct to the wearer and five\\nmonths later he had earned a thousand dollars.\\n“I simply took advantage of a situation with which the trade is familiar,”\\nHawkins said. “Every experienced shoe salesman knows people have only a\\nvague idea of the size of their shoes. You’d be surprised to know how many\\ntimes the average person buys ill-fitting shoes in his lifetime, believing he is\\nproperly fitted. That’s because it’s impossible for a shoe store to keep a\\ncomplete stock of sizes, widths, styles and colors of the lines it handles, all of\\nthe time. When the store is out of the proper size, the clerk substitutes a size\\nclose to it, and the average person doesn’t know the difference.\\n“I have trained myself to tell at a glance if a person is properly fitted.\\nProspects, wearing ill-fitting shoes, usually complain of being hard to fit and\\ndoubt that I can give them shoe satisfaction. I tell them: ‘I guarantee the fit. If\\nthey don’t fit, you don’t pay.’ Shipment is made C.O.D. but I make certain to\\ncall up my customers about the time their shoes arrive. I know there won’t be\\na substitution as my orders are filled at a wholesale warehouse.”\\nIt took about four weeks before people became fully aware that the shoes\\nHawkins sells would actually be better fitting than store shoes. He sold his\\nfirst order to an engineer of a railroad, and the engineer was so pleased that\\nhe told his fireman. When Hawkins called back upon the railroad man, he hadtwo orders waiting for him. The fireman bought, so did one of the trainmen.\\nLater he got orders from thirty-three men working in the railroad yards, all\\ntraceable to the first order. Meanwhile, he called upon a local foundry and\\nmachine company, and got an order there from the foreman. When this man\\nreceived his shoes, he phoned Hawkins.\\n“I’ve never had a better fitting pair of shoes,” the foreman declared, and\\nHawkins was told to call back later. He received orders for sixteen pairs of\\nshoes on this one call. Hawkins makes an average commission of one dollar\\nand twenty-five cents on a pair of shoes, which he collects in advance. The\\nshoes retail at less than three dollars. The commission is deducted from this\\nprice and the balance is collected on delivery by the mail-carriers. Hawkins\\ncarries no stock of shoes, but sells from a sample. A special order blank\\nmeasure supplied by the company assures accuracy in getting the proper size.\\n“It doesn’t take long to learn the knack of fitting, and when you get the knack\\nand sell a man a pair of shoes that fit him, he will gladly recommend you.\\nMost of my sales come that way. From my first fifteen sales, I have obtained\\nninety-seven orders. It took about two weeks for my first order to be\\ndelivered. After that first two weeks, it was plain sailing. It was almost four\\nweeks before I got a real break in repeat business, and up to that time I only\\nsold twenty-nine pairs of shoes. Then, orders piled up fast.”\\nHawkins declares it is possible to get orders from women and men on a\\nstraight canvass every day. He, however, specializes on selling men’s shoes,\\nand calls only on men who are working in factories, shops and offices. While\\nhe makes few calls—about fifteen a day—he does a large volume of\\nbusiness.\\nJames Horner Became a “PremiumSpecialist”\\nI\\nT IS human nature for the average person to want something for nothing\\nJames C. Horner knew that and decided he could make a thousand dollars\\neasier selling premiums to merchants than he could by doing anything else.And this belief seems to be justified by his results. His success is due to the\\nplan he uses which is so simple and practical that it is surprising others have\\nnot tried it.\\n“The plan,” explained Mr. Horner, “is to call upon the best merchant in town.\\nI give him about two hundred coupons to start and also some printed signs for\\nthe windows, circulars to he given store customers, and a sample premium\\nfor display purposes. The merchant gives out these coupons with five-, ten-\\nor twenty-five-cent purchases, and when the customer has saved up a certain\\nnumber, she is given a premium. The success of the premium as a business\\nstimulator depends upon its quality—it must compare favorably with items of\\nthe same sort which are sold in the store and it must be something the\\nhousewife wants but feels she can’t afford to buy at the regular retail price.\\nOffering premiums that do not meet these requirements won’t develop much\\nbusiness for you. I usually suggest electric clocks or silverware. The clocks\\ncome in radio, mantel and wall-clock styles and have proved to be\\nparticularly good business stimulators.\\n“When the clock premium idea gets under way, I secure a surprising amount\\nof repeat business from the stores. Frequently they re-order twenty-five or\\nthirty clocks at a time. After the clock premium has been used for a while, I\\nsuggest that it be followed by another premium, such as silverware. A good\\nquality silverplate can be given in the same way as the clocks, and those store\\ncustomers who have had clock premiums, begin saving for silverware. This\\nkeeps them trading at the store and builds up a steady business for the\\nmerchant.\\n“I call back upon each merchant several times, not only to keep him friendly\\nbut to show him the right way to use the premium. I have found practically\\nno objection to premiums by the merchant. The idea, as every merchant\\nknows, is essentially sound and about the best sales stimulator he can find.\\nMany merchants, I point out in my sales talk, have found that the use of\\npremiums saved their business from suffering serious losses during the worst\\nperiods of the depression. The public’s popular acceptance of the premium\\nprinciple bears out this contention and helps me close orders. I call on the\\nsmaller towns exclusively. I don’t object to cities, but it takes too much of mytime waiting to see the store manager in a city store.”\\nHorner works in Wisconsin. He calls on the stores in Watertown, Madison,\\nKenosha, Racine and Janesville. He restricts his premium deals to one store\\nof each kind, and his commissions average seventy dollars weekly from calls\\non twenty stores a day. Every merchant feels the necessity of increasing his\\nsales, and is ready to listen to you when you call to tell him about a method\\nthat will bring in new customers as well as keep old customers coming back.\\nPremiums can be used by the filling station, drug store, small department\\nstore, variety store, jeweler, grocery, meat market, hardware dealer and\\nrestaurant. You need no capital to start. Companies which make a business of\\nsupplying premiums will send you the full details of their plan, and its sales\\npossibilities.\\n$1,000 from Selling Fire Extinguishers\\nI\\nF YOU were to ask Frank DePries how to make a thousand dollars, he would\\nanswer without a moment’s hesitation: “Sell fire extinguishers.” That answer\\nwould be drawn from his own experience too, for DePries has made that\\nmuch money in a six-week period. It was about two months after he became\\nconnected with the fire extinguisher manufacturer’s organization that he set\\nhis record. During his first month he didn’t earn much. He made a number of\\ncalls, but his percentage of sales was low. “Here was my trouble,” said\\nDePries. “I was calling upon people who were not good prospects. In\\naddition, I had no selling experience when I started and was lost in a maze of\\nconflicting notions about selling. Soon I discovered I wasn’t getting\\nanywhere. My earnings were sometimes five, sometimes ten dollars a week.\\nThere were two weeks when they didn’t total twenty dollars. However, I\\ndecided that if someone else could make big money, I could.\\n“I knew I was selling about 50 per cent of the prospects that had a use for the\\nextinguisher, but nine out of every ten people I called upon had no real use\\nfor it. Many calls and interviews, therefore, were a waste of time. One night I\\ndiscussed this situation with my wife, and she said the sensible thing to dowould be to call only on prospects that needed an extinguisher. This had not\\noccurred to me, but it sounded good, so I spent the next day studying the\\nclassified telephone directory and made up a list of firms which I believed\\nneeded extinguishers. I listed twenty-seven firms in one business district.\\nThese calls were fairly close together, and I routed them so I wouldn’t waste\\ntime going from one to the other. That day’s commissions totaled thirty-six\\ndollars.”\\nDePries sets a quota of twenty-five calls a day. Out of these twenty-five calls\\nhe averages sales of twelve fire extinguishers. This does not mean that he\\nsells twelve different concerns, for one small factory may give him an order\\nfor ten or twelve extinguishers. There was one week when his commissions\\namounted to a little over three hundred dollars, and in one ten-week period he\\nearned nearly a thousand dollars in commissions.\\nDePries concentrates his calls on small factories, wholesale houses,\\nwarehouses and garages. Fire insurance underwriters have approved the\\nextinguisher he is selling, and, as a consequence, he is able to point out to\\nprospects that possession of his extinguisher will reduce the cost of their fire\\ninsurance.\\nThe company which manufactures the equipment which DePries sells does\\nnot require experienced salesmen, nor does it demand a cash investment from\\nsalesmen. Any ambitious man or woman may make a salesman’s connection\\nwith the organization.\\nA Business Selling Mending Fluid\\nW\\nHILE visiting a friend, Dwight C. Ritchie, of Pablo, Montana, noticed a tube\\nof mending liquid lying on a table. “What’s that for?” asked Ritchie. “Why,\\nit’s for mending small holes in shirts and socks. It’s great stuff. Takes but a\\nminute to mend a tear, or a hole in a silk stocking,” the friend replied. Ritchie\\nmade note of it. He wasn’t married and had to mend his own clothes, so he\\nbought a tube. Later he wrote to the manufacturer, and requested a connectionas a local representative. Never having sold house-to-house, he found much\\nto learn in the first few weeks of his new job. However, he soon learned the\\nimportance of a good demonstration and before long, his earnings from daily\\nsales were averaging around twelve dollars.\\nRitchie’s sales averaged six dozen daily. There were days when his sales ran\\nbetween ten and twelve dozen tubes, from which his profit, clear of all\\nexpenses, was as much as twenty-two dollars. He didn’t have an easy time,\\nhowever. He admits being lucky the first few days for, as time went on,\\nproblems of many kinds confronted him which made selling difficult.\\n“A product people want, and have a daily need for, is important. More\\nimportant, however, is the way it’s sold,” Ritchie said frankly. “I knew the\\nproduct was all right. I experienced difficulty convincing many others, until I\\nbegan to sell systematically. When I tried to sell one woman, living on a farm\\njust out of town, she told me she had no money but as I was willing to accept\\nfarm products in payment I suggested that she trade one of her chickens for\\ntwo tubes. Another woman lacking money offered to trade eggs.\\n“Many have to be shown what the product will do. So I have a demonstration\\nbook which I use when making a brief demonstration. To this demonstration\\nbook, I add such items from current magazines and newspapers as will help\\nclinch sales. In this book I also carry pieces of silk stockings, cotton cloth,\\nlinen and other fabrics, which I have repaired with this product. Turning to\\npages of this book, I point to these fabrics and remark: ‘When you get a run\\nin a silk stocking just touch a little mending fluid with a toothpick or a broom\\nstraw to the top and bottom of the run, and if you want to patch it, you can do\\nso in one-fourth the time.’ I clinch my points like this: ‘You see you can\\nmake repairs much quicker and better than with needle and thread,’ and when\\nthe prospect nods agreement, I go on. ‘Now, you’ll want two or three tubes.\\nThe price is twenty-five cents.’ I hold out the tubes. Few women turn me\\ndown. Many take three, and some buy as many as four tubes. Others just take\\none. So many women say, ‘No, I don’t want anything,’ when they open the\\ndoor. At first this remark would stop me. Now I answer. ‘That’s all right. I\\njust want to show you how to stop a run in silk hose.’ My demonstration\\nstarts from there.”Ritchie is a hustler. Making an average of sixty-seven calls daily keeps him\\non the go from early morning until almost dark. But he declares that if you\\nwant to make money you have to get out and work for it.\\nTo get started with a small specialty, such as Ritchie is selling, requires no\\ncapital investment. The product may be sold anywhere. A search for many\\nnew uses for the product broadens the possibilities of its sales, and is\\nrewarded by increased profits.\\nSelling Protection Against Death\\nI\\nN DENVER , Colorado, T. J. Devers startled his friends when he earned a\\nthousand dollars in five months by selling memberships in a mutual benefit\\nassociation. When he started, Devers was broke. He had answered an\\nadvertisement and received instructions on how and where to get new\\nmembers. Devers thought little of the “canned sales talk,” as he styled it,\\nwhich the company sent him. However, he did need cash badly, and since the\\nproposition offered a way to get it, he decided to give it a chance.\\n“Don’t let anyone tell you it was easy,” he said, talking about his first sale.\\n“It was anything but easy to find a man who was willing to pay five dollars to\\njoin this benefit association. That membership fee, collected at the time the\\napplication is made out, was my commission. At first I made the mistake of\\noverselling my prospects. I was talking with an old man and promising him\\neverything I could think of, when he said sharply: ‘Young fellow, you’re a\\nliar. You might sell me if you’d stop lying and tell the truth.’ I said, ‘All\\nright. I’m starting out with this proposition. I don’t believe you’re in good\\nhealth. If you are, and you want to join this association, sign the application\\nand give me five dollars.’ He didn’t sign. He said no doctor in the county\\nwould say he could live more than a week, but if I saw his son, I might get an\\norder. Although I had no assurance the boy would buy, I located him,\\nexplained that his father sent me, and this time, told the truth about my\\ncompany. The boy took one of my policies, and paid me the initial\\nmembership fee. That was my first sale. I had learned one important thing.That was the importance of telling the truth about the mutual benefit policies.\\nLater on, I learned another and that was to learn all there is to know about the\\npolicies and the protection they provided. I spent almost seven weeks\\nlearning everything I needed to know about them. Meanwhile, I wasn’t\\nselling many memberships.\\n“As time passed, though, I became convinced that I could sell them. The\\nthing that was holding me back was not knowing where to find prospects who\\nneeded protection. Usually, the man who is able to carry old line insurance is\\nnot a prospect for mutual benefit policies. But those who have been forced by\\ncircumstances to drop their old line policies are in need of some protection.\\nThe mutual benefit plan is a godsend to them, inasmuch as the cost of this\\nprotection is relatively small, compared with the cost of regular life\\ninsurance. These benefit policies require no medical examination, and pay\\nbenefits up to a thousand dollars. The monthly cost is only one dollar, which\\nmost people can afford to pay.\\n“I struck up an acquaintance with an old line insurance solicitor one\\nafternoon, and we talked about business. He told me that many of his\\ncustomers were forced to give up their big policies, and were carrying only\\nsmall industrial policies. That made me curious to see these people. I asked\\nhim if he would tell me the names of a few new lapsed policies on his debit,\\nand he did this readily. I called on them. Being careful not to say anything\\nthat would be looked upon as knocking the old line company, I explained that\\nthis mutual policy was actually replacing the larger old line insurance in\\nmany instances, where the family could not afford to keep up their premiums.\\nI then pointed to the low cost, and the safety features of the benefit policy I\\nwas selling. I sold each one of them and in a day or so called back offering\\ntwo dollars commission for each policy I sold to friends they recommended.\\nThey took advantage of my offer and gave me the names of friends and\\nrelatives. Within a week I had signed up fifty-four memberships from those\\nrecommended. These in turn recommended a number of others and within a\\nshort while I had all the prospects I needed.”\\nUnique Cigarette Dispensing Humidor“\\nI\\nMADE my first thousand dollars placing cigarette humidors in apartment\\nhotels and homes,” Charles Dagmar told a Dartnell staff writer in search of\\nmoney-making ideas to include in this book. “Since both women and men\\nsmoke cigarettes these days, I figure making an average sale of two packs of\\ncigarettes daily from each humidor. At an average profit of four cents this\\npays a good return on my investment. Getting locations for these home\\nhumidors is no more difficult than getting locations for any coin machine.\\nThere is this difference, however, you don’t pay any commission to the\\nowner of the location.\\n“When the home humidor first came to my attention, I thought it was\\na good idea. Carrying some photographs of the humidor with me, I called\\nupon the owner of three big apartment hotels, and ‘sold’ him on the idea of\\nletting me place a humidor in each apartment. ‘It’s a self-merchandising\\nmachine,’ I argued, ‘saves the tenant’s time, and offers him the convenience\\nof fresh cigarettes day and night. If he runs out of cigarettes he doesn’t have\\nto go out to the store to get them.’ That argument, and the beauty and utility\\nof the humidor, appealed to the apartment hotel owner. He said that he would\\nhave to place a piece of furniture in each apartment similar to the humidor\\nanyway, and as long as he didn’t have to pay anything for the use of the\\nmachines I could install them. In his hotels there are a hundred and four\\napartments and I placed a humidor in each. As my average profit is four cents\\non each package of cigarettes sold, my earnings run close to $375 monthly\\nfor these three hotels.\\n“These humidors are excellent pieces of furniture. They come in various\\nstyles such as end tables, occasional tables, telephone stands, magazine and\\nnewspaper racks and card tables. The humidor is so constructed that it keeps\\ncigarettes fresh for an indefinite period. It can be loaded with fifteen\\npackages of cigarettes, which are enough for the ordinary household at one\\ntime. If more than two in the family smoke I make two trips weekly and refillthe humidor. Service is the keynote of success with this product. I take my\\nmoney from the cash box on each trip.\\n“The convenience of the humidor is quickly apparent to the average man or\\nwoman who uses cigarettes. The favorite brand of the user may be placed in\\nthe humidor so that there is no objection to the cigarette itself. Almost\\neveryone has had the experience of smoking his last cigarette late at night,\\nduring a party in the home, or while listening in on a distant radio program. I\\nremind hotel men of this experience if any additional argument is needed to\\nplace the humidors.”\\nDagmar paid one-third cash and agreed to make a monthly payment of a\\nsmall amount of his earnings for the humidors which, when bought in\\nquantities, cost $13.50 each. He has placed these humidors in several\\napartment hotels and in many homes. There seems to be an unlimited field\\nfor this machine, especially in large cities where there is a tendency for\\nfamilies to live in small furnished apartments. There is also an opportunity to\\nmake money with this coin machine in the small community. Collections are\\nmade weekly, and a steady income is assured from each humidor, once\\nplaced.\\nSelling Printing Specialties to Business Men\\nI\\nT HAD been raining all morning, and when Johnson McCloud entered the\\noffice of a doctor in Akron, Ohio, he found the physician gloomily looking\\nout the window at the rain. “Nasty weather, isn’t it!” commented Johnson. “A\\nday like this is a good day to write letters to delinquent patients.” Turning\\nfrom the window, the doctor nodded, moved to his desk and slumped into a\\nchair. He waited for the doctor to say something, but he remained silent.\\nJohnson opened his portfolio, and produced an assortment of sample\\nletterheads. “What do you think of these?” he said, handing them to the\\ndoctor. The doctor admitted the letterheads were good. “I couldn’t use\\nanything quite so expensive, however,” he said evasively, “there’s no need\\nfor it in this business. I use only a few cards, envelopes, bills, and letterheadsand I get those from one of my patients who is a printer.” “It’s a good idea to\\npatronize the local printers. However, I think you’d\\nbe surprised to know how little it would cost to print up your letterheads and\\ngive you a better quality. My house specializes in standard forms. We handle\\nbig runs of job stuff too, and some small runs, where we can work them in,\\nbut the prices I can quote on letterheads, billheads, cards and envelopes will\\nsurprise you.”\\nMeanwhile, the doctor was considering the paper stock of the letterhead. His\\nattitude was that of a man bent upon killing time, rather than that of a person\\nkeenly interested. The price, evidently, didn’t seem so much of a factor.\\nJohnson watched him closely. He handed him an envelope. “Feel that paper!”\\nThe doctor took it and nodded. “What do you pay for your letterheads, may I\\nask?” inquired Johnson. “Oh, I don’t know exactly. Offhand, I’d say it wasn’t\\nmuch. Two and a half, or maybe three dollars a thousand. My, but it’s\\nraining.”\\nJohnson ignored the doctor’s last comment and handed him a third printing\\nsample. “Do you order in quantities of five or ten thousand?” he inquired.\\n“Lord no! Five hundred or a thousand is about all I need.” “Fine,” said\\nJohnson, “now, which of these sample papers do you like best? Some prefer a\\nhigh-grade tinted stock; others like a heavy white paper like this. I can fix\\nyou up with this stock, a thousand letterheads and envelopes to match, with\\nyour name and address printed as on the samples in bold, modern-faced type,\\nfor $20.90—and that price includes both the letterheads and envelopes. That\\nrepresents a saving of about two or three dollars on these two items. Shipped\\nexpress collect from the plant. You pay me only a small deposit now and the\\nbalance when the job is delivered.”\\n“How do I know that I’ll get this same quality printing?” the doctor\\ndemanded. “Here is the guarantee,” replied Johnson, “it covers everything.\\nSee? It’s printed on your receipt. I’ll leave it with you—it’s a part and\\ncondition of the order.”\\nJohnson McCloud left that doctor’s office with a small order and arecommendation to three other physicians with offices close by. That day he\\nsold $57.00 worth of printing and his commission amounted to $17.11.\\nDuring the first six months at this work, Johnson’s commissions totaled\\n$1,400. While it may seem that he must have made some rather large sales to\\nearn commissions such as these, he claims that all of his sales were made to\\nmen who ordered in relatively small quantities.\\n“My orders vary in size,” he said, “some being as low as $1.50, others up to\\n$35.00 or $40.00. I’ve never had an order for more than $45.00.\\nCommissions vary on this line, and on some jobs I make more money than on\\nothers. My efforts are concentrated on business men, but I never overlook a\\nstore, restaurant, factory, doctor, lawyer or dentist. I had some difficulty\\nduring my first two months in finding just how to approach my prospects, but\\nI solved this problem slowly. I have found almost every prospect I call upon\\nrequires a slight variation of selling method, and that a standard sales talk or\\nmethod of approaching prospects does not do the trick. There are basic\\nfundamentals, however, that apply to every case. It is important to place\\nsamples in the prospect’s hands quickly after getting in, and keep him\\nfingering samples throughout the interview. If you can focus the prospect’s\\nattention on samples and keep it there, you will usually sell him.”\\nJohnson McCloud never brings up a subject which may cause the prospect to\\nthink of anything but the sale under consideration, during the interview.\\nSelling standard forms, letterheads, billheads, envelopes and circulars is\\nmade easy because there are a number of concerns, with special machinery,\\nwhich can handle such orders at unusually low prices. The quality of such\\nprinting generally is higher than that of a local printer and the cost to the\\nprospect is much less. These are two strong arguments which can usually be\\ndepended upon by the salesman to close sales quickly.\\nBringing the Store to the Customer\\nC\\nHARLES GRAVES pulled his green sedan to the curb, took a package\\ncontaining a dozen towels from the rear seat, and hurried to the door of thewhite cottage. A woman answered his ring. Graves said: “You told me, Mrs.\\nMarkham, that if these towels were the size and quality I said they’d be,\\nyou’d order other goods. And I have some real bargains.” Mrs. Markham\\ninvited Graves into the house. There she opened the package of towels and\\ninspected them carefully. “They really are wonderful. And so cheap,” she\\nremarked.\\n“Certainly,” Graves returned quickly, “and you’ll find everything you buy\\nfrom me is of the same high quality. Remember, Mrs. Markham, you don’t\\npay for anything until I deliver it and you inspect it here in your own home.\\nYou see, I operate on a small profit from my car. I don’t have the tremendous\\noverhead a merchant has. And you know the merchant figures up his rent,\\nlight, wrapping paper, cost of fixtures, interest on money invested in the store\\nand stock, taxes, and all that sort of thing, and adds that to the price of\\neverything he sells. If he didn’t he wouldn’t make a dime. He’s entitled to it.\\nBut I eliminate this cost, and pass the benefit on to you in the form of bigger\\nvalues. Now here’s something you’ll appreciate: Picot topped, 320 needle\\nsilk chiffon hose. Silk from top to toe. A dozen to a box at only $5.20 a box.\\nCan you beat that?” “That does sound reasonable,” replied Mrs. Markham.\\nThe prospect feels the sheer silken material, mentally makes an effort to\\ndetermine the price for each pair, and concludes it’s about forty cents or a\\nlittle over. And Charlie Graves is off on a new sale!\\nHe’s been selling merchandise in this way for three years. He makes a point\\nof offering good quality at fair prices, and does a big business. During his\\nfirst six months, he made a very good living and put almost a thousand\\ndollars in the bank.\\n“I believe that you must merchandise to make money,” Charlie declared. “I\\nmean by that you must be able to show value and build a sales talk to make\\nthe most out of it. It is true that I sell most items under the regular store prices\\nand that my costs are less. My profit runs a little higher on each sale,\\nhowever, than the store operator’s. That’s because I’ve been buying from\\nwholesalers who deal in bankrupt stocks. They buy up an entire stock of\\nbankrupt goods at a price. They sell it at small profit to themselves, and turn\\nover their money quickly. Seldom can they supply a variety of items thatwould enable a store operator to stock up on a line of one item large enough\\nto interest most store people. But they have enough high quality merchandise\\nfor small fellows like me to keep going on. My big talking point, of course, is\\nprice.\\n“I use the ‘sandwich’ method of building up orders. When talking to a\\ncustomer I ask what she is paying for, say, her husband’s socks at the local\\ndepartment store. She tells me. ‘I have a very fine sock that I know would\\nplease him, and the price is only $1.59 in dozen lots,’ I say. ‘What are you\\npaying for towels? I mean the large-size Cannon turkish bath towels?’ She\\ntells me and I go on, ‘I can sell you a package of one dozen Cannon bath\\ntowels, the large size, at $2.10 a dozen—less than twenty cents each.’ These\\nare two low-priced items in constant demand. I don’t make much on them,\\nbut I make a good profit on most of the other items I carry. So after throwing\\ntwo low-priced items out to catch interest, I whip in a profit maker. Say it’s\\nsoap. I get this hand soap, a regular ten-cent item, at one and a half cents a\\ncake, and offer it at four for a quarter. Then I mention another profit maker,\\nsuch as a house dress. After that, I mention a lowpriced leader item, and by\\nthat time the prospect has the impression that every item I have is very\\ninexpensive. That’s what I mean by merchandising the goods.”\\nSome of Graves’s orders run as high as $30.00, and his average is $4.75. His\\naverage profit is $1.69 an order. Graves has built up a regular route, calls on\\nthis route once every three weeks, and makes an average of twenty-three calls\\ndaily. He closes orders in twelve out of the twenty-three homes he calls upon,\\nand his daily earnings average close to $19.00. His entire equipment consists\\nof his stock, in which his original investment was $50, and the car he drives,\\nwhich cost him $300 at a used car lot. You can build up a business as\\nprofitable as that of Graves in your own community with a small investment.\\nHow Cord Earned His First $1,000E.\\nL. CORD, president of the Cord Corporation, who built up the Auburn\\nAutomobile Company, and is the directing head of many important business\\nenterprises, made his first money rebuilding Ford cars. He bought a $75\\nsecond-hand Model T Ford. He geared it for high speed, added a homemade\\nracing body, gave it a coat of paint and sold it for $675.\\nThe plan worked so well that he bought twenty Fords, put them through the\\nsame rebuilding process and sold them all for an average profit of $500 per\\ncar.\\nOf course, this opportunity is gone today. But there are other similar\\nopportunities. Second-hand goods of all kinds are constantly being traded in\\non new goods. Washing machines, radios, vacuum cleaners are frequently\\ntraded in long before their life usefulness has ended. A few new parts, a coat\\nof paint or enamel will put them into a salable condition.\\nThere’s a real opportunity in almost every town or city for the man who is\\nmechanically inclined, who has a few tools and isn’t afraid to get his hands\\ndirty, to make a good living reconditioning second-hand household\\nequipment.\\nAlmost every dealer who takes in second-hand equipment offers a pitifully\\nsmall allowance on it. To get rid of it he is often willing to sell it for just what\\nhe paid. At times even less. There is a steady market for rebuilt and\\nreconditioned household equipment. Hundreds of people who do not want to\\npay the price of new equipment are good prospects for rebuilt equipment.\\nAll you need to start is a few tools and one second-hand machine, such as a\\nwasher, vacuum cleaner or refrigerator. The first step is to take the equipment\\napart, clean it thoroughly, replace worn and broken parts, refinish where\\nneeded. Then you are ready to make your first sale. Offer your first rebuilt\\npiece of equipment to your next door neighbor. If he doesn’t buy, offer it to\\nthe next nearest neighbor, and so on until sold. As you make each sales call,ask them if there is some other piece of equipment in which they are\\ninterested. After you have made a few calls, you will have taken orders for\\nsome other equipment which you can buy second-hand, rebuild and sell.\\nSome men who have tried this plan have orders for all the rebuilding they can\\ndo for weeks ahead.\\nA safe plan to follow is to add the cost of the equipment and the cost of all\\nthe parts and materials to a fair price for your time and labor in rebuilding.\\nThen add 50 per cent to this figure to arrive at your selling cost. Thus, if you\\npaid $7.50 for a used washing machine, spent $3.25 for new parts, enamel,\\netc., and two days’ labor, your price would be, figuring your labor at $4.00 a\\nday, $7.50, plus $3.25, plus $8.00. This totals $18.75. Add 50 per cent and\\nyour selling price is $28.12. This would leave you a gross profit of $9.37,\\nafter paying yourself $4.00 a day for your work. Some rebuilders pay a\\ncommission of 20 or 25 per cent to others for selling. To do this, you should\\ndouble your costs after paying yourself wages. For example, on the washer\\nwhich cost, including your labor, $18.75, the selling price would be $37.50,\\nwhich would carry a 20 per cent commission for selling. This price would net\\nyou $30, or a profit of $11.25. The extra profit is to pay you for the time your\\nsalesmen will inevitably take up, and the necessary help you will be forced to\\ngive them.\\nUsing Old Customers to Get New Ones\\nC\\nHARLES ANGLE , of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, raised his extract business\\nfrom an ordinary $20-a-week enterprise to one which paid him $4,000\\nannually by developing a customer cooperation plan among women who\\nbought extracts. It is a plan that might solve your problem, just as it did his.\\nMr. Angle explained his plan as follows: “There isn’t a big profit in extract\\nsales. My special four-bottle deal, selling for ninety-nine cents, with a\\ngenerous-sized package of dessert thrown in free, is a quick seller. However,\\nthere is only a thirty-cent profit for the salesman. You have to sell a lot of\\nthese special offers to make any real money. I went along for a while up herein Milwaukee doing a big business but not getting much profit. Then I\\ninterested a woman in boosting my flavoring extracts to friends, promising\\nher four bottles and the special dessert free for each five she sold for me. This\\nworked out so well that I made the same offer to another woman living two\\nblocks away. She promptly got busy on the telephone and turned in orders for\\n39 specials in less than a week. I rewarded her by giving her a pair of silk\\nstockings in addition to the promised bottles of extract.\\n“After that experience, I made more effort to secure customer cooperation\\nthan I did to make direct sales. In two months, I had established 34\\ncooperating customers on this plan in the Milwaukee area, each of whom\\naveraged 12 sales a week for me. I gave them some inexpensive prizes for\\ntheir efforts.\\n“I have discovered that women will gladly do their best to recommend a\\nworth-while product if they feel their efforts are appreciated. They like to\\nbelieve you are not going to forget them. A card at Easter and Christmas was\\nsufficient to line up several women who had fallen out of the habit of\\ncooperating with me last year. One woman, who had been very active helping\\nme get business, but who had given up for several weeks, was once more\\nadded to the active list when I sent her little girl a birthday card.”\\nAngle has always been a hard-working salesman, but admits that without the\\ncooperation of his women customers, he would never have climbed out of the\\nsmall earning class. He points out that the cost of the gifts distributed to the\\nwomen cooperators seldom exceeds one-third of the commission, an amount\\nhe can well afford to pay. He declares that were he to appoint these same\\nwomen as subagents, however, they would not secure the same amount of\\nbusiness for him.\\nThe extracts and flavoring Angle sells are of good quality. He buys at\\nwholesale, and the bottles come in special containers. He is not required to\\nbuy any definite quantity to secure the wholesale price. The company\\nsupplying him gladly ships in any quantity, regardless of the size. For this\\nreason, Angle, without capital, has been able to build up a good business.\\nToday, there are 46 women boosting his sales in, and near, Milwaukee. Theyphone in their orders after five-thirty, when he returns home from making his\\ncanvass of the district. An average of two sales daily is turned in by these\\nwomen, which, with Angle’s personal sales, brings daily profits between $14\\nand $19.\\nAntiques Are Coming Back\\nJ\\nACK OVERHAUSS drove a truck for a Chicago retail furniture dealer. One\\nday he was instructed to take the truck over to a railway warehouse and pick\\nup a spinning wheel, said to be an expensive antique the dealer had difficulty\\nacquiring. Later when he unpacked the spinning wheel, Overhauss recalled\\nhaving played with a similar spinning wheel, when a boy, in the attic of his\\nmother’s home at Jackson, Minnesota. He mentioned this to his employer.\\n“If you know where there’s another spinning wheel like this and can get it for\\nme,” the dealer told him, “I’ll pay you fifty dollars.” Overhauss promptly\\nreplied he knew where there were at least a dozen near Jackson, and was told\\nto get them. Overhauss went up to Jackson, inquired among his mother’s\\nneighbors about their spinning wheels, and in less than a week obtained seven\\nat an average cost of four dollars each. Before returning to Chicago he\\nsecured a total of thirty-nine spinning wheels from residents of Jackson and\\nsurrounding territory, who were glad to dispose of them at the price\\nOverhauss offered just to get them out of the way.\\nDuring his stay in Jackson, Overhauss kept on the alert for other items. While\\nseeking spinning wheels, he noticed a number of articles in the attics and\\nbarns of the homes and farms he visited, such as flint lock pistols, flint lock\\nmuskets, bowie knives, bows and arrows used in Indian warfare, spears,\\nhatchets, unique caskets, and other objects which had been kept by the\\nfamilies for many years but which no longer possessed sentimental value for\\ntheir owners. Overhauss listed these articles and sent copies of the list to\\nseveral furniture and antique dealers. Within a few days he received an order\\nfrom one dealer for the entire lot and realized a profit of over $300.Very little capital is required to make money from antiques. You can start this\\nfascinating business right in your home community. In every town there are\\nten homes or more whose attics contain furniture and various articles\\ncollected over a period of years. Before buying any of these, make a list of\\nevery article you find that is worth while and send copies of this list to\\nfurniture manufacturers, furniture dealers, antique shops, and collectors in\\nlarger cities. When replying, the dealers will mention the amount they will\\npay for each article. Those who have prospects for the articles listed will\\ngladly pay good prices.\\nWhile the demand for antiques fell off during the depression, it is coming\\nback with the return of better times and the revival in building. During the\\nperiod of prosperity we are now entering, thousands of homes are going to be\\nremodeled and refurnished. Many of these home-owners will refurnish in the\\nearly American style, because of its charm and distinctiveness. This will\\nbring back with a bang the demand for all kinds of antiques and those who tie\\nin with this movement are bound to reap profits. It’s an interesting business,\\ntoo, and may lead to your becoming an interior decorator with a shop and\\nfactory of your own.\\nSullivan’sCollectionSystemPortfolio\\nI\\nN SEATTLE , Washington, H. J. Sullivan made $1,080 in fifty-three days.\\nHe did it by selling a collection system to local business men during the\\nworst months of the depression. “My commission runs about twothirds of the\\nselling price,” Sullivan said. “On a $7.50 unit I make a profit of $5.00, and on\\nthe higher-priced units the commission is relatively higher. My biggest\\nadvantage was my list of acquaintances. I knew most of the first 200 business\\nmen I interviewed, and had enough selling experience to understand how to\\nhandle prospective users of the system whom I didn’t know personally. To\\nclinch the sale after I had a man interested, I used a portfolio of letters of\\nendorsement supplied by my firm. This portfolio was a gold mine. It\\ncontained hundreds of letters from business firms in every line of business,from a small grocery store or market to a big public utility corporation. These\\ncompanies were located in every state in the Union.\\n“I was broke when I started out with this system, but it wasn’t long before I\\nwas making real money. My first call was on a small factory where the owner\\nknew me from the old days when I sold him merchandise. I said: ‘I’ve got\\nsomething here which I’m sure you’ll agree is a mighty wonderful collection\\nstunt. There are a number of concerns which owe you money you think you\\nwill never get. Well—look at this.” I opened up this mammoth portfolio of\\nreference letters and picked out the names of several leaders in his line of\\nbusiness. He read the letters—every word of them. There isn’t a business\\nman in the country who doesn’t perk up with real interest when he sees what\\nhis competitors are doing. ‘What’s the system you are selling?’ he asked. I\\nexplained it to him, pointing to my samples and letting him examine the\\nentire method. ‘If you collect only one old account with this method,’ I said,\\n‘the system will have paid for itself.’ He agreed with me on this, and gave me\\nhis order. The commission on this sale was the easiest money I had ever\\nmade.\\n“My next six days were devoted principally to thinking up answers to\\nobjections. Then I saw that it wasn’t an answer that was needed. These\\nobjections became selling points when properly analyzed. I hadn’t been\\ninquiring about the total amount of the prospect’s bills receivable, but I\\nchanged my canvass a little, and early in the interview brought up that point.\\nMost business men do not know how large an amount of money they have\\ncoming until they look at a balance sheet. Then they are a little surprised and\\noften worried about it. When I’d ask a prospect what the total of his bills\\nreceivable amounted to, he generally called the bookkeeper and requested a\\nstatement. Intently he would consider that statement. ‘I guess we should use\\nsome kind of system. How much did you say that one cost?’ he would usually\\nremark, and the order followed.”\\nSullivan pointed out that he doesn’t make many calls in a day, since it often\\nrequires as much as an hour for his selling interview. He averages ten calls\\ndaily, however, and of these sells six, giving him a high percentage of\\nclosures. His commissions run better than $8.00 a sale.Collection systems are much in favor during the present era of tight credits.\\nWhile you may not make as much money as Sullivan did selling this system,\\nit does offer an opportunity for the inexperienced man who prefers calling on\\nbusiness men in factory, office, shop or store. A store unit, declares Sullivan,\\nruns about $7.50. The others are in larger amounts. The commission is either\\ncollected in advance, or the full amount of the order may be collected C.O.D.\\nupon delivery, and the commission sent to the salesman.\\nHow the Waffles Sell Moth Tabs\\nJ\\nAY WAFFLES and his wife together earned twelve hundred and seven\\ndollars in six months selling deodorants in and around Rockford, Illinois, and\\nnear-by small towns.\\nWaffles, forced to quit his job in a Rockford factory because of his health,\\nwas sent to Mayo Brothers Hospital in Minnesota, where, after several\\nweeks’ treatment, he was discharged. At home he didn’t improve as well as\\nwas expected, and was told that a trip to California would hasten his\\nrecovery. Waffles hadn’t enough money to make the trip. “We must get some\\nmoney quickly,” declared his wife. One day the following week they made a\\nsales connection with a manufacturer of moth tabs.\\n“We sold a few moth tabs to our neighbors during the first week,” said Mr.\\nWaffles, “but not enough to increase our bank account. The usual excuse\\noffered by most housewives was ‘I have no money.’ Every woman in town\\nseemed to be just out of ready cash when we called. It stumped us. Mrs.\\nWaffles would go down one side of the street and I down the other. We’d\\nmeet at the end of the block, and compare notes. ‘There’s nothing in it,’ I said\\ndisconsolately one day. She didn’t agree with me, and reminded me that the\\ncompany had mentioned one man who had made a success. I said frankly that\\nI doubted it. That night we were feeling pretty blue when we got home. We\\nwere eating supper when the doorbell rang, and Mrs. Waffles answered the\\nbell. I heard her say to the man at the door, ‘Not today, I have no money.’\\nThe salesman didn’t seem to hear her at all. He went right on with his salestalk. She kept repeating over and over that she had no money, and finally he\\nwent away. When she rejoined me, she said: ‘I think if he had remained\\nanother moment I would have bought from him. He certainly had a good-\\nlooking can opener.’ ‘Maybe people would buy from us, too, if we stood at\\nthe door a little longer,’ I remarked absently, and she stared at me. ‘That’s\\njust it. It must be!’ she exclaimed. ‘Do you know what? We don’t make half\\nas effective a sales talk as that man did. We must improve it.’”\\nThe Waffles went into a huddle and came out with a brand new canvass.\\nThey tried it out on each other that night. Long after midnight, they retired\\nand awakened the next morning enthusiastic over their new plan. “We’ll\\ncheck it as we go along,” they decided. That morning’s sales were better.\\nTheir combined profits amounted to six dollars and ninety cents. But better\\nthan that, they began to discover the weakness in their sales presentation. It\\nwas then that they started the habit of writing out what the prospect said, and\\nwhat the Waffles answered after each interview. This took a little time and\\nreduced the number of calls, but within a week it increased the percentage of\\nsales to interviews from 10 per cent to 60 per cent. They saw another\\nweakness in their method. They were carrying five items, the leaders of\\nwhich were the moth tab, bowlitizer, and refrigerator deodorant. The three\\nitems together paid them a seventy-five cent profit. They had been talking up\\nonly one item. Now they found the way of selling the other two after getting\\nthe order for the one. The result was more income from every sale. In two\\nweeks, they had increased their profit from six dollars a day to twelve dollars\\ndaily.\\n“If every woman who raised an objection were counted, I guess the total\\nwould include every woman in the country,” declared Waffles. “Certainly\\nthey object. But a skillful turning of the objection and a little selling pressure\\nwill make them buy. I was told fourteen times by one woman that she didn’t\\nhave any money in the house, but each time I smiled, agreed with her, and\\nthen pointed out how much money could be saved by using the moth tab.\\nAfter ten minutes, she invited me inside to let me show her how easy it was\\nto hang the tab in the clothespress. I told her, meanwhile, I did not expect her\\nto buy a thing, but if she knew about the products, and wanted them later, she\\ncould phone me. I told her about a special preparation for keeping moths outof her overstuffed furniture and she led me to the living room to demonstrate.\\nHere we sat down while she examined and bought every item I was selling.”\\nWaffles makes the delivery of the products when he makes the sale, and\\ncollects the total selling price. He buys the deodorants from the manufacturer\\nat a low rate and resells to his prospects at a good profit.\\nPossibilitiesofIndustrialUniforms\\nW\\nHEN Chester Burton walked from the office of the White Front Service\\nStations, Inc., he had an order in his pocket on which his commissions totaled\\n$69. That order, the result of an hour and a half interview with the purchasing\\nagent and the general manager of a chain of 17 gasoline filling stations, was\\nfor 107 work uniforms, on the front and back of which the name “White\\nService Stations” was to be embroidered. It wasn’t the first order Burton had\\ntaken. It was the second he had that day, the first being for a smaller number\\nof garments from a local garage. It was typical, however, of the kind of\\nmoney he was able to make selling industrial uniforms to gas stations, hotels,\\nauto agencies, moving companies, dairies, factories, restaurants, druggists,\\nlaundries, bakeries, and offices where industrial uniforms have come to be\\nconsidered a necessary thing.\\nIt took Burton, who didn’t have a moment’s selling experience before he\\nbecame connected with the manufacturer of these uniforms, exactly five\\nmonths to earn his first $1,000.\\n“Don’t think it was easy for me to get my first real week’s salary out of this\\nline. I puttered around with it for several days before I got the right idea. I\\ncalled on prospective users of industrial uniforms, of course. I showed them\\nthe samples of materials and explained the methods used in making up the\\ngarments. I talked wear, strength and durability, and I didn’t get to first base.\\nSomething, I thought, was wrong with me, with the line, or with the method I\\nwas using. Determined to find out what was wrong, I devoted my next three\\ndays to an exhaustive quizzing of buyers. And I found out why I wasn’tgetting business. In my desire to impress durability and wearing qualities, I\\nhad been making a comparison of my garments to overalls. I had completely\\noverlooked one of the strongest selling points in connection with the uniform.\\n“These concerns do not want overalls. They want a uniform which looks\\nneat, is properly styled, and in some cases, tailored, and which lends dignity\\nto the appearance of the workman. Gasoline stations were particular on this\\npoint. ‘Our men come in constant contact with the public,’ I was told by a big\\nchain buyer, ‘and we must insist that they have an alert, snappy appearance in\\ndress. An appearance that may be kept uniform in all stations is necessary to\\nidentify attendants of this company.’ Here then, was the new idea I was\\nseeking. I took the answers to my questions and made up a sales talk, using\\nthe buyer’s own arguments and showing where my uniforms served every\\nrequirement. I photographed some gasoline service station attendants who\\nwere wearing the uniforms. I showed these photographs, together with\\ndrawings in my portfolio, to the buyers for other companies. I added\\nphotographs of doctors, druggists, and others to make the collection\\ncomplete. I didn’t pay a lot of money for these pictures, but took a small\\nkodak with me everywhere I went. When I recognized one of our uniforms\\non an employee, I stepped up and got a snapshot.\\n“All this proved to be valuable when closing a sale. Some big companies\\nwant to see what a uniform looks like when a man is wearing it. I can quickly\\nshow a photograph, which is just as good as showing a uniform. They get the\\nidea.”\\nIt might be pointed out that Burton finds little competition in his sales work,\\nand has systematized his calls to make the most of his time every day. His\\naverage daily earnings are close to $17, and he calls on about twelve\\ncompanies each day. There appears to be no real reason why any aggressive\\nand ambitious person should fail to make money with this line.\\nFive Dollars Starts Stamp Exchange\\nW\\nHEN James Wallen was graduated from high school, he went out to look fora job, but jobs were scarce. So he decided to go into business for himself.\\nRummaging around in the attic, he found in an old trunk a letter addressed to\\nhis mother. The letter was written back in 1870. The envelope bore a two-\\ncent black stamp with a portrait of Andrew Jackson on it. He took the\\nenvelope (known to philatelists as a cover) to a stamp dealer and sold it for\\n$5.00.\\nWith the money thus secured Jimmy purchased a Scott’s stamp catalog and\\nthree packages containing about three thousand mixed “missionary” stamps\\n—that is stamps sent in to dealers by church missionaries from all over the\\nworld. Jimmy had long been interested in history and geography and found\\nthe stamps held a great fascination for him.\\nHe conceived the idea of selecting one particular stamp and finding out\\neverything he could about it. He wrote an interesting story about the man on\\nthe stamp. He then went to the history teacher in the local school and sold her\\nthe idea of using stamps to teach history. In that way he started a stamp\\n“craze.”\\nJimmy tied in with the “fad” by getting five students to act as his agents to\\nsell stamps to other boys. He went to a printer and had stationery and\\napproval sheets printed with his name. It wasn’t long before he had turned a\\nlarge portion of the original three thousand stamps at a nice profit.\\nWith this money he purchased a larger supply from a wholesale stamp house\\nin Boston. He began putting up small packets of especially sorted stamps\\nwhich he sold through several stores in town on a consignment basis. When\\nthese assortments failed to move fast enough, he changed them about until\\nthey did sell.\\nJimmy now sends stamps to all parts of the country and a number of foreign\\ncountries. The number of his boy agents in near-by towns is constantly\\nincreasing. He has made his first thousand dollars and is on the way to his\\nsecond thousand.A “Killing” on Carded Merchandise\\nW\\nHILE talking with a customer about his regular line, Carl O’Neil, a cigar\\nsalesman, got an idea which enabled him to earn better than $1,000 within\\nnine weeks! Just as the storekeeper stopped talking with O’Neil, a young man\\nentered the store. The cigar stand proprietor asked him what he wanted. The\\nyoung fellow took two display cards of five-and ten-cent merchandise from a\\nsample case, and showed them to the cigar man. “There’s 120 per cent profit\\non this card for you,” said the newcomer, “these carded products sell\\nthemselves.” One card was filled with envelopes containing aspirin, and the\\nother had packages of razor blades attached. The lithographed cards invited\\nthe store patrons to serve themselves. There wasn’t much of a sales talk\\nneeded to show the store man the advantage of an open display from which a\\ncustomer could take small items without bothering a clerk. In less than two\\nminutes, the cigar man bought one of each of the cards, paid the young\\nsalesman and returned to O’Neil who had been listening meanwhile. When\\nthe other salesman left, O’Neil made note of the name and address of the\\nmanufacturer of the carded products from the card left with the cigar man,\\nand that night wrote a letter inquiring about the possibility of selling carded\\nitems as a side line.\\n“I got the connection right away,” said O’Neil, “bought a few cards to carry\\nwith me, and decided to introduce them to my regular cigar dealers. Being\\nacquainted with every cigar man in my county, I was sure I could make extra\\nmoney which I badly needed. I had no trouble selling my first twenty-five\\ncards, and reordered twenty-five more. The goods sold themselves from the\\ncards in a store when they were displayed in the proper place.\\n“Usually I placed the cards where I knew they would attract attention.\\nSometimes the store man moved the cards around, however, and would\\ncomplain that the merchandise didn’t sell. Others said they had carried such\\nmerchandise, but hadn’t been able to do much with it, and refused to buy.\\nThis complaint was pretty general for my first two weeks and held down my\\nsales. But wherever the store man left my cards in a good spot in the store hesold a lot of this merchandise. That got me thinking. I couldn’t force a store\\nman to keep my card where I wanted it. But if I knew enough about displays,\\nI could teach him to leave it where I put it. I studied store displays. A good\\nplace to put the card is close to the cash register. Another good place is on the\\ntop of the glass display case in which the low-priced cigars are kept. I told\\nthis to my customers and figured out for them in dollars and cents exactly\\nwhat the value of this space was to them when they displayed my\\nmerchandise. The results were surprising to me. In less than a week most of\\nmy customers ordered additional cards and told me to place them where I\\nthought they would do the most good.”\\nO’Neil did so well that soon he gave up selling cigars and concentrated on\\nthe sale of carded merchandise. Loading his car with fifty cards each\\nmorning, he drove through the country, established regular routes, and placed\\ncards with every kind of store. He makes ninety calls a day, and sells an\\naverage of one card for each two calls. His profit is never less than twelve\\ndollars daily. During one stretch of nine weeks, he worked intensively on a\\nplan to get merchants to display three cards where they had been displaying\\none and his commissions for the period were $1,019.20.\\nInexperienced salesmen who do not relish house-to-house selling, may find\\ncalling on stores with carded merchandise unusually profitable. Cigar stands,\\ndrug stores, grocery stores, bus stations, railway stations, magazine stands,\\nhotels, and restaurants offer a ready outlet for carded merchandise.\\n“Taking a Chance” on Soap WinsforFitze\\nC\\nARL FITZE , a house-to-house soap salesman calling on housewives in\\nDayton, Ohio, uses what he calls a “gambling system” for getting business\\nwhich has enabled him to earn handsome profits. The effectiveness of his\\nselling method may be appreciated when it is considered that he started out\\nwith practically no capital, investing only one dollar and fifty cents for a\\nsupply of soap to start his business. When this was sold, Fitze took the entire\\nproceeds and reinvested them in more soap, and pyramided his purchasesuntil he had built up a large soap inventory. His first week was a\\ndisappointment. Most women, he knew, had enough money in the house to\\npay for a box of soap. The price he asked—thirty-nine cents a box—was\\nreasonable for a box of soap, generally priced much higher. Nevertheless, it\\ntook him two days to sell his first ten boxes, although he worked hard at the\\njob.\\n“Wherever I called I was usually given the same story,” he explained. “‘I\\nwon’t have any money until Saturday when my husband gets paid,’ is what I\\nheard many times each day, and I’d turn away from the door, to be greeted at\\nthe next door with the same ‘reason.’ On my third day as a soap salesman I\\ntold one woman who gave me that excuse, ‘All right. I’ll leave the soap now,\\nand come back, say Monday. If you wish, you can pay me a small deposit\\nnow, or you can pay the entire amount Monday. Just as you prefer.’ She\\nthanked me, and said that would be all right, so I handed her a box of soap,\\nwrote her name and address in a book, and went on to my next call. Here\\nagain, I met the same objection in the same way by leaving another box of\\nsoap. At the next three calls, however, my readiness to trust the housewife\\nbrought out the cash, and by early afternoon I had sold fifteen boxes of soap\\nfor which I was to collect later, and collected the full amount for ten more. I\\nwas then all out of soap so I took all the money I had collected to the\\ncompany that supplies me with soap and reinvested it in a fresh supply. The\\nnext morning I used the same argument I had used the previous afternoon\\nwhen women told me they had no money. Within two hours I left twenty-five\\nboxes, fifteen of which were cash sales. Again I returned to the company and\\nthis time secured thirty boxes, which I disposed of before dark.\\n“When I called back to make collections for the soap on the following\\nMonday, only one woman refused to pay me. My profit on the sales up to that\\ntime was forty-six dollars, so I could stand the few cents loss nicely.”\\nFitze continues to use his “system” with remarkable results. Each morning he\\nstarts out with a sack containing twenty-five boxes of soap, and along about\\nnoon returns to get another twenty-five. Sometimes he sells as high as\\nseventy-five boxes a day. In one four-month period, he averaged a daily sale\\nof sixty-two boxes and made over a thousand dollars. By making aboutninety-five calls daily, Fitze averages around fifty sales. As his profit is\\ntwenty cents a box, he makes an average income of about ten dollars a day.\\nThe beauty about a business such as Fitze has built up is that he is dealing\\nwith necessities. Everybody uses soap. Everybody buys soap. They buy it in\\nhard times, and they buy it in good times. It repeats, too, which makes it\\npossible for a man to build up an established business quickly.\\nIf you find in selling house to house that you are constantly running into the\\nobjection, “I have no money today,” try Fitze’s plan. Leave your product on\\nthe payment of a small deposit or, if it is an inexpensive item, without any\\ndeposit. About 99 per cent of the human race is honest and you probably will\\nnever have any difficulty collecting your money when you call back. And\\nremember—it is one way to get past the door and to put your product into the\\ncustomer’s hands!\\nEvery Man Wears Shirts\\nC\\nLARENCE B. TRAVIS wondered how he could make $1,000. He found a\\ngood line of shirts which he sold direct to the wearer, and soon had the\\nmoney he needed. Last month he put another $1,000 in the bank. Travis, who\\nlives in Port Arthur, Texas, was disappointed at the beginning but once he\\ndeveloped the plan he now uses he began making money hand over fist.\\n“I won’t say this plan differs materially from the plan of other fellows,” said\\nTravis. “I believe a good many men are using similar plans. In brief, it is to\\nforget about the call, and think about a connection. Not long ago I called\\nupon a prospect occupying an executive position in a cheese factory. He told\\nme he had given an order to a direct salesman a year or so before, and was\\n‘swindled’ so badly he was determined never to buy from a house-to-house\\nsalesman again. All the other salesman had thought about was an order. The\\nprospect said that he had to wait an unreasonable time before his order came\\nand when it did arrive, his shirts were not as he had ordered. I admitted the\\njustice of his complaint, but pointed out that because this one man had broken\\nfaith all others would not also. I didn’t get his order then, but after many callsI succeeded in convincing him he would get his money’s worth from me.\\nThat was sometime ago. Today he is a satisfied customer and has\\nrecommended me to many of his friends.\\n“Shortly after I started selling, I entered a local garage to see if I could\\ninterest some of the men in a medium-priced shirt. I was confronted by a\\nhard-boiled, grim visaged superintendent who informed me I was wasting the\\nmen’s time. Hurriedly I explained it wasn’t my intention to interfere with his\\nmen, and that the error was undoubtedly due to my lack of experience. I then\\nurged him to tell me when it would be convenient to return and interview\\nthem. I made a point of being very courteous to this fellow, and as I agreed\\nthat he was right, he calmed down a great deal, his gruff manner softened,\\nand he asked me what I was selling. I showed the samples, explained and\\ndemonstrated them, and he gave me his order. Then he said that if I talked to\\nonly one man at a time, it would be all right. His men who had witnessed this\\nscene were impressed by his purchase, and I left with orders for fifteen shirts.\\nI tried this same idea half an hour later in the office of an express company\\nwith good results. That started me calling on industrial plants and offices, and\\nled to many sales. While a majority of such calls resulted in firm turndowns,\\nthere are enough offices and factories where the foreman or superintendent\\nwill let me talk to the men to make this system profitable.”\\nTravis makes most of his sales in units of three shirts. He carries shirts of\\nvarious prices, however, and his commission varies between sixty-five cents\\nand a dollar on each. Specializing on factories, offices, and stores, he\\nmaintains an average sale of fifteen shirts daily, although he only makes\\nseven interviews a day. Some shirt salesmen concentrate calling on business\\nand professional men, and carry socks, ties, and underwear as additional\\nlines. The shirts, such as Travis sells, are made to measure from material\\nselected by the prospect, and shipped C.O.D. The deposit, required when the\\norder is placed, is retained by the salesman as his commission.\\nGifts for Young Men to Give to Girls\\nTHERE are certain specialties manufactured today that open a wide range of\\nmoney-making opportunities for men and women. Some of these are\\nluxuries; others combine utility with novelty. George Lehman decided a\\ncigarette case, which kicks out a lighted cigarette when you press a button,\\nwas a good money-making idea. His commissions from the sale of this lighter\\nexceeded $1,000 in three months! Here is his story:\\n“This cigarette case appealed to me as one of the things many men would go\\nfor, but I’ll admit that my first efforts to sell it were a washout. Everyone\\nliked its appearance. They thought it was novel and all that, but they didn’t\\nseem to have the money to buy. Then I realized I was not calling on the right\\npeople. Those I talked with were men working on a small salary and barely\\nmaking a living. I sought out younger men. One gave me a cue by buying a\\ncase for his ‘girl friend’ as a birthday gift, and she was delighted with it. He\\nwas so pleased that he phoned me and said a pal of his wanted one for his\\ngirl. I followed up the idea of selling the cigarette case to young men for gifts\\nand began immediately to make money.\\n“I found that the fellow about twenty or twenty-five, who isn’t married, likes\\nto flash a novel cigarette case of this kind. No matter where you are, you’re\\nsure to have someone ask to see the case when you press that button and a\\nlighted cigarette jumps out. I soon exhausted most of the young men\\nprospects I knew, but by that time I had decided to go after sales in a more\\nefficient way. Any man who has driven a car knows how awkward it is to\\nlight a cigarette in traffic. With one of my cases, the auto-driver merely\\npresses the button, and a lighted cigarette immediately pops between his lips.\\nSo I devoted most of my energy to showing this case to auto-drivers. I didn’t\\nhave to do much talking. I’d stand at popular gasoline stations and, when a\\nman stopped for gas, show the lighter and explain it. One out of every twelve\\nasked me the price of the lighter, and when I mentioned it, bought without\\nany further urging.\\n“Experience taught me that the best place to show the lighter was at the gas\\nstation while the man was behind the wheel. He is most easily sold then\\nbecause he is driving. He, no doubt, wanted a cigarette and in fishing first in\\none pocket for a package, and then in another for a match, probably camenear going off the road. Naturally, he welcomed a cigarette case such as I was\\nselling. It is quite a different matter in his home or office, however. The\\nmotorist at home forgets all about the inconvenience of lighting a cigarette\\nwhile driving, and when in his office his mind is on other things. Thus, the\\nbest place to catch him is at one of the many gasoline stations at busy\\nintersections. The gas station attendants usually don’t mind having me hang\\naround. There’s always some little thing I can do to help around there, and I\\nam someone to talk to when business slumps off.”\\nLehman sells as high as sixteen cigarette cases daily, netting him a profit of\\n$17.37. On days when the traffic is unusually heavy, he sells as many as\\nthirty-five cases. The selling price, $2.50, does not seem too high to\\nprospects.\\nLehman’s success with this case is typical of the success of many specialty\\nmen, once they find the right spot to sell their products, and the right way of\\nintroducing and demonstrating them.\\nGreeting Cards Made Money forEttinger\\nL\\nAST year, James J. Ettinger needed some extra money. He knew that\\nhundreds of men and women make good money around the holidays selling\\ngreeting cards. But instead of trying to sell his cards house to house, he\\nconcentrated on two special fields—the professional and the service station\\nfield. By concentrating his calls on these types of prospects, he not only made\\na maximum number of calls in a minimum of time, but he spent his efforts on\\ntwo practically unworked fields.\\nHis campaign was mapped out to cover only the office buildings in his town\\n—particularly those buildings which housed doctors’ and dentists’ offices.\\nFor these prospects, he carried two kinds of cards—one for personal and\\nanother for business use. In order to get in to see the doctor, he concentrated\\non selling the office girl first. When he had sold her, he would ask to see the\\ndoctor or the dentist. Usually the office girl was impressed with his sincerityand his evident desire to please, as well as with the excellent line of greeting\\ncards he carried. Having reached the doctor or the dentist and succeeding in\\nmaking a sale, the next step in his campaign was to sell the wives of these\\nmen. Generally, he would get permission to telephone from the doctor’s\\noffice making an appointment to show the line of greeting cards.\\nHis success with this “endless chain” method of selling was due to making\\nthe prospect feel that he was an important customer and impressing him with\\nhis need, as a professional man, of the right type of greeting card. After\\nmaking a few sales, he found it fairly easy to size up his prospect and decide\\nwhether he would like something conservative, something radically different\\nor something showy. Most professional men do not like to be rushed and\\nwhen they are not busy they like to talk. This talkativeness gives Ettinger a\\nchance to get the names of other prospects, and he never fails to ask whether\\nthe doctor’s brother, or uncle, or sister, or aunt, or any other member of the\\nfamily he may mention would be interested in selecting Christmas cards.\\nIt wasn’t long before Ettinger found that most of the doctors’ offices are\\npretty busy in the afternoons. Furthermore, they close early. So he decided to\\ncover the service stations in the afternoons, evenings, Saturdays and Sundays.\\nThis was a field that also needed what Ettinger was selling and a field that\\nfew salesmen approached. Nearly every service station in a residential section\\ndepends upon the business received from the immediate area surrounding it.\\nThis steady day-after-day trade is the backbone of the business and, naturally,\\nthe operator wants to keep in touch with his customers. Ettinger found that\\nthese men were glad to buy greeting card remembrances from him.\\nThe first efforts Ettinger made to sell greeting cards at the holiday season\\nnetted him $295 in five weeks! He doesn’t believe he could have made this\\nmuch money selling house to house, although others have done well with the\\nhouse-to-house plan. Ettinger prefers the highly specialized field and the\\nquick sales results. This year he expects to make considerably more money\\nbecause he not only knows how to go about getting prospects, but he has a\\nnumber of customers’ names on his calling list. He will also start earlier and\\nget in another week’s work.chapter three\\nMAKING THINGS TO SELL\\nO\\nVER in Oberammergau, Germany, there is a colony of people who, for\\ngenerations, have been wood carvers. They specialize in religious carvings.\\nYears ago, when the only outlet for works of art was the church, the founders\\nof this little colony began carving religious statues and selling them to\\nchurches. They became so much interested in the history of the men whose\\nlikenesses they portrayed in wood, that they conceived the idea of re-enacting\\ntheir lives. Thus out of one art developed a greater art and soon the\\nOberammergau Passion Players became famous the world over. But the\\nPassion Play was the result and not the cause of their success as wood\\ncarvers. Today, in ritualistic churches all over the world, the religious\\ncarvings of Anton Lang and his associates have become very valuable. Proud\\nindeed is the church, whether it be of the Roman or the Anglican faith, which\\nboasts a wood screen or a crucifix carved in Oberammergau.\\nNow if the Oberammergau wood carvers were only one or two people it\\nwould be easy to dismiss their great success on the grounds that they had a\\nnatural gift for carving. But nearly every person in Oberammergau carves,\\nand carves unusually well. Which simply goes to prove that being able to\\nmake anything well is not so much a matter of being gifted, as it is being\\ninterested enough in what you make to be willing to acquire through patient\\npractice the skill that success requires. There is a world of wisdom in the old\\nsaying that genius is one-tenth inspiration and ninetenths perspiration.\\nYou frequently hear people say: “How I envy So-and-So; if I only had his\\ngift of being able to write.” It is true some people have more natural ability\\nthan others when it comes to expressing themselves on paper. But you will\\nusually find that the permanently successful novelists and shortstory writers\\ngot where they are because they liked to write in the first place, and then\\nwrote, and wrote, and wrote until they perfected a style or specialty which\\nmade their work stand out above the crowd and catch the imagination of the\\npublic. It has been said, with a good deal of truth, that if you have aspirations\\nto be a successful short story writer, the way to begin is to write a hundredstories, and throw them all into the waste paper basket. Then send your one\\nhundred and first story to a publisher. The point is that no matter what you\\nelect to make or do, skill requires practice. It is better to practice on yourself\\nthan on those whom you hope will some day buy the things you make.\\nBut don’t let the need of practice discourage you from trying. Rather let it\\nsteel you against the discouragements which always go with selling things\\nyou make. Remember that even Anton Lang, the Oberammergau wood\\ncarver, was once a beginner. At one time in his life he was just as inept as\\nyou are so far as wood carving is concerned. True, he had the help and\\ninspiration of the more experienced men in the village, but just the same he\\nwas a beginner. So was every great artist. Remember then that you can never\\narrive until you begin. And having begun, never for a single moment allow\\nyourself to become discouraged or to depart from the straight course you\\nhave elected to follow. For that is the all-important thing in success—staying\\non the main track all the time.\\nNaturally, you are going to be most skillful at the things you really like to do\\nbest, so it is easier to be successful when you work with materials you like to\\nhandle. If you like the feel and the smell of wood, you will be happier—and\\nprobably more successful—making things of wood than working with metal.\\nIf your mind is precise, exact, and mathematical, cabinet making may be your\\nforte. What kind of tools do you like to use? Do you feel at home with a\\nscroll saw, lathe or forge? Or tools such as a knife or chisel may interest you\\nmore. If you have the “watchmaker’s mind,” you are likely to be more\\nsuccessful making intricate little models of ships, designing engines or\\nbuilding model houses.\\nIt may be possible that you are not now successful selling what you make\\nbecause it is not the sort of thing you like to do. A man may work for years in\\na certain field and find that long after his prime, he could have made a better\\nliving working at the thing he really enjoyed doing. If necessity has made it\\nimpossible for you to make a choice in your vocation, keep up your hobby\\nthat you really enjoy, and sooner or later you may find an opportunity to turn\\nit into money.Free Training in Handicrafts\\nIf you have tried to make things and have given up, feeling that you could\\nnever acquire the necessary skill to turn out a good product, perhaps you just\\nlack a few pointers in handling your tools properly or selecting the right\\ndesigns. In most of the larger cities, the public schools give free courses in\\nhandicrafts. The Young Men’s Christian Association also holds classes in the\\napplied and fine arts. Students of either sex, of any age, may enroll in these\\nclasses for a small fee. There are several magazines on the newsstands which\\ncater to the craftsman, and the U. S. government publishes bulletins which\\nwill give you exact plans and instructions in making many things for use on\\nthe farm or in the home. The public library in your city has dozens and\\ndozens of books that tell how to make things. Manufacturers will send you\\ninstructions for the use of their products. There is plenty of help for the man\\nor woman who is eager to acquire skill in his work.\\nWith a few good books or other material to guide you and plenty of practice,\\nyou can develop skill in practically any type of work you really like. When\\nyou have reached the point where your work begins to look professional, then\\nyou must start thinking of ways and means of marketing your product. For no\\nmatter how well you make a thing, you will not make a profit from your labor\\nuntil you find a market for it. Even before you begin making things, it is a\\ngood idea to find out what your community needs and likes. A walk through\\nthe department stores, the gift shops, the woman’s exchange, and other sales\\noutlets will give you some idea of what the public is buying.\\nThe trend today leans toward the “streamline” effect in practically everything\\n—from automobiles to kitchen knives. Keep away from the outmoded\\ndesigns. Look through the women’s magazines and the periodicals on interior\\ndecoration and furnishings to find out what is in good taste today. The\\npresent trend toward the “classic modern” in furniture suggests that you omit\\nexcessive ornament from any cabinet work, but it means that your work must\\nbe superior in design and execution in order to achieve that clean streamlined\\neffect. Linens, rugs, glassware, china, jewelry, lamps, picture frames, ash\\ntrays, kitchen implements and equipment, as well as furniture, all have more\\nor less of a tendency toward the modern in design. This does not mean thehideous art moderne which cluttered up the country a few years back.\\nBeware of any designs that border on that short-lived “epidemic” in house\\nfurnishings. In a number of magazines you will note a tendency toward the\\n“Victorian” in furnishings. However, this style of ornate furniture and\\ndecoration will undoubtedly prove to be more or less of a fad. We live in a\\nmodern, machine age and a modern style of design seems to be more fitting.\\nThe old colonial type of furniture and decoration is in demand today, but\\neven the colonial is being produced by manufacturers in keeping with the\\nmodern lack of ornamentation and simplified lines.\\nSuiting Your Product to Your Market\\nWhat is your community like? Is it a suburban section where people are\\ninterested in garden furniture, rose trellises, fireplace equipment, bird houses,\\ndog kennels, door knockers, sun dials, hooked rugs, handmade quilts,\\nhandmade furniture, pottery and other beautiful things for their homes and\\ngardens? Perhaps your community is an apartment district, where people\\nhave little time to make good things to eat. Try selling your bread, or cake, or\\ndoughnuts, or baked beans to these householders. Or your painted tin ash\\ntrays, parchment lamp shades, cocktail tables may suit their fancy. If a great\\nnumber of children live in your community, whose parents have medium to\\ngood incomes, then toys, nursery furniture, colored cutouts of animals, and\\nsimilar projects may be money-makers.\\nWhen your product is ready for the market, it can be sold through the gift\\nshops, the woman’s exchange, through advertisements in your neighborhood\\nnewspaper, by word-of-mouth advertising, by opening a small shop in your\\nhome or in an inexpensive location, or by taking space in a successful shop\\nselling something unlike your product. You may also be successful selling it\\nhouse to house. If it is possible at all, have your product on display in some\\nspot where people shop. Let people know what you are making—tell your\\nmerchant, your neighbors, people you talk to on the street car or at a ball\\ngame, the service station attendant, your doctor, the milkman—in fact, tell\\nthe world. You can’t expect people to search you out—you must go to them\\nwith your product.Billy B. Van and His “Pine Tree” Soap\\nB\\nILLY B. VAN used to be in the show business. His job was to make people\\nlaugh. Just as he felt that he was making some progress toward becoming\\nestablished in his chosen profession he developed tuberculosis and had to\\nleave the show in Boston. He had little or no money at that time, so the\\nmembers of the company and other friends financed his period of\\nrecuperation in the White Mountains in New Hampshire. Here he regained\\nhis health and in two years was able to go back to the theater for six months.\\nHis long stay in the pine forests gave him two ideas: One, to take the fresh,\\nfragrant odor of the pines to people who had neither the time nor the money\\nto get to the pine woods; the other, to build up a business that would support\\nhim comfortably as soon as he could leave the theater.\\nHe decided that soap was the product that would suit his purpose, and he\\nexperimented with many formulas before he found one which would actually\\nhold the fragrance of the pine needles. After searching around a bit, he\\ndiscovered a man who would make the soap for him in quantities. However,\\nhe, Billy B. Van, would have to go out and sell it. At first, he laughed at the\\nidea of a comedian becoming a salesman. Then he realized that this was what\\nhe had been doing all during his show life—selling; he had been selling\\nhimself to his audience night after night. It should be easier to sell soap, he\\nreasoned. So each morning he filled his pockets with samples of his soap, his\\nheart with hope, and started ringing doorbells.\\nThere were difficulties. There always are. The druggists didn’t know his soap\\nand wouldn’t stock it; the jobbers wouldn’t move it, and he had no money for\\nadvertising. Suddenly the idea came to him that he could introduce his soap\\nthrough the hotels. Most of his life had been spent in hotels and he knew\\nhotel managers from one end of the country to the other. But the hotel\\nmanagers thought it a huge joke—Billy B. Van selling soap! He soon found\\nthat there was no short-cut to prosperity selling to friends. He finally secured\\npermission to place a trial order in a hotel. Around each cake of soap he\\nwrapped a circular stating: “This soap will keep everything clean but yourconscience.” A coupon was attached to the circular which read, “Dear Billy: I\\nlike your soap. Send me six cakes. Here’s your dollar.” The idea worked like\\na charm. Many orders came from the hotel’s guests. In this way, Billy B. Van\\nhad put the reverse English on direct-mail advertising. As he had no money\\nto write to prospects he arranged for them to write to him! This was the\\nopening wedge in the merchandising of the Pine Tree Soap. From that time\\non, little by little, he progressed with his merchandising plans. Eventually he\\nbuilt up a lucrative business in the White Mountains where the pine trees\\nsend out their clean, healthy fragrance.\\nThe point to this story is not, however, that Billy B. Van, one-time showman,\\nbecame a successful soap manufacturer, but that by doing the obvious thing\\nhe made money. So many people foolishly suppose that the only ideas that\\nare any good are the clever ones, which nobody ever thought of before. The\\ntruth is that the ideas that make the biggest money are usually those which\\nare only waiting for somebody to pick them up, just as Billy B. Van picked\\nhis Pine Tree Soap idea out of the air of the New Hampshire mountains.\\nThere were many brands of soaps on the market when Billy B. Van started to\\nsell his soap, but as he found out, there is always room for another product—\\nif it has quality and answers a specific need.\\nKnapp Specialized in Pressed Chicken\\nI\\nN EVERY farming community there is an opportunity to start a “pressed”\\nchicken business. No skill and very little capital is required. You simply\\ncontract with the farmers and poultry raisers in your community for their\\nchickens when they become too old to lay and too tough to eat. Because they\\nare such tough old birds you don’t pay much for them. Then you buy or\\nborrow a steam pressure cooker, and you are in the pressed chicken business.\\nThat there is good money to be made quickly in such a business is\\ndemonstrated by the experience of the Knapps, The Knapps have a poultry\\nfarm in Eaton County, Michigan, not far from the State Capital. In addition to\\nselling eggs—there is a capacity of 2,000 laying hens at the farm—quite afew chickens are also sold, mostly broilers. However, at the end of the\\nbreeding season there are, of course, a number of old hens and stags which\\nmust be marketed for which only the lowest prices can be obtained. After\\nhandling the left-over stock in this manner for some time, the idea occurred\\nto them that they might be able to make a profit by cooking the old birds and\\nselling them as “pressed chicken.”\\nThe chickens for this purpose are best cooked in a pressure cooker as cooking\\nunder pressure requires only from 30 to 40 minutes, whereas cooking in an\\nopen kettle requires from two to three hours. In addition to reducing the time\\nspent in cooking, the pressure method of cooking produces a much richer\\nproduct than the open-kettle method as the additional water required in the\\nlatter method naturally reduces the rich stock. With a pressure cooker Mrs.\\nKnapp was able to save the cost of the extra cooking time. After the chicken\\nis thoroughly cooked, the meat is cut into cross sections (to reduce the length\\nof muscle shreds), seasoned to taste (some seasoning is added during\\ncooking), the chicken stock is added, and a tablespoonful of plain gelatin.\\nThe extra gelatin helps to keep the mold firm and makes for easier slicing of\\nthe loaf when it has set. The molds should be greased to prevent the contents\\nfrom sticking and when filled they are placed in the refrigerator to set. In\\naddition to making plain loaves, Mrs. Knapp also adds sliced vegetables,\\nolives, the riced white and yolks of hard-boiled eggs, etc. By preparing the\\nloaf in layers a very attractive summer dish can be made. To form this loaf,\\nthe chicken should be cooked in the usual way, the white meat separated\\nfrom the dark meat and each kind cut fine or run through a food chopper. The\\nyolks and whites of several hard-boiled eggs should be chopped up separately\\nand each seasoned well. Then the four ingredients, the white meat, dark meat,\\negg yolks and egg whites, should be mixed with the chicken stock which has\\nbeen cooked down thick enough to jell. The white and dark meat and the\\nyellow and white egg should then be arranged in layers, pressed in a pan or\\njar and allowed to set overnight.\\nAdding water to the stock results in a larger quantity of food, but, of course,\\nthe product brings a lower price. In a quality market a loaf should sell for 50\\ncents a pound. As a five-pound male bird, at the usual 45 per cent loss,\\nshould dress out to about two and three-quarter pounds, the return on one birdwould be about $1.28. By adding water and doubling the amount, a product\\nwould result which could be sold for about 25 cents a pound. Although the\\naddition of water would make a loaf not nearly so rich, the return per bird\\nwould be the same. Whether to dilute the product or put up a richer loaf\\ndepends entirely upon the market. If a quality market can be developed and\\nyou can secure 50 cents a pound for the loaf, it means making as much\\nmoney on fewer customers and, therefore, less selling effort. However, if the\\ntrade prefers a lower price and the diluted product, there is nothing to do but\\ncater to your market.\\nHandkerchiefsfortheChinese\\nF\\nLORENCE ROCHESTER was a secretary in the attorney general’s office\\nat Topeka, Kansas. But Mrs. Rochester needed more money. To appease both\\nthe need for more cash and to do something more artistic than copy legal\\nbriefs, she began making dainty little lace handkerchiefs in her spare time.\\nShe found a ready sale for them among her friends. She spent as much time\\nas necessary to turn out just the kind of handkerchiefs she liked, bought as\\nexpensive material as she wanted, and charged for the handkerchiefs\\naccordingly. That was back in 1926.\\nIt was not long before these friends began showing their handkerchiefs to\\ntheir friends. The demand for Rochester handkerchiefs grew. Before she\\nrealized it, Mrs. Rochester was in the handkerchief business!\\nWhen orders began to pile up and she no longer was able to make the\\nhandkerchiefs and hold her regular job, she talked over the matter with her\\nhusband, a civil engineer for a railroad company, and he advised her to quit\\nher job and concentrate on handkerchiefs. She did. She saw that if she built\\nup the business she now was determined to have, she must sell to stores\\nrather than depend on sales direct. She called on two near-by department\\nstores with samples. She sold orders to both. She went back home and opened\\nher “factory” in her own home.It was the same old story of the world beating a path to the door of the person\\nwith quality merchandise—except that Mrs. Rochester did not wait for this\\npath to be beaten. She went out and told merchants about her handkerchiefs.\\nToday Mrs. Rochester not only sells handkerchiefs to merchants in every\\nstate in the country except three, but to foreign countries as well. Foreign\\norders grew so fast she opened a branch factory abroad to expedite export\\nbusiness.\\nStart a Pie Bakery\\nF\\nIVE years ago in Benton Harbor, Michigan, the John Mayers started a pie\\nbakery. If you want to buy cake, cookies, bread or doughnuts, you have to go\\nelsewhere to make your purchases; the Mayers’ idea was to do one thing\\nsuperlatively well and they have succeeded in baking pies that are good\\nenough to keep people coming back for more. The market for their pies\\nconsists of hotels, restaurants and the near-by summer resorts. Quite a few\\nare sold direct to consumers at thirty-five cents a pie.\\nThe usual demand in any American community for good pie has enabled the\\nMayers to build up a profitable business, keep up a nice home which they\\nown, have a car, and provide a comfortable living. There is a limitless market\\nfor pies as practically every other man who enters a restaurant orders pie even\\nthough he knows it may not be particularly good. Just why there are so few\\ngood pie bakers in a country where dessert generally means “pie,” is one of\\nthe great unsolved mysteries. There is really no competition for the person\\nwho has the knack of baking pies like those “mother used to make.”\\n$100 per Month with Felt Work\\nR\\nUTH G. JONES , a widow living in San Antonio, needed money and neededit quickly. She had had no commercial or business experience of any kind\\nprior to her marriage; she had no special ability or talent. What could she do?\\nOne day she heard the son of a friend complain that he was unable to find\\nanyone who could cut out letters properly and sew them on his baseball\\nuniform. That gave Mrs. Jones an idea. She investigated and found that none\\nof the sporting goods stores in the city had equipment for furnishing this\\nservice. There was, she found, a little shop that did this felt work so she went\\nover and had a talk with the proprietor. The outcome was that she took over\\nthe shop, equipped it properly, and went out after business.\\nThe only experience Mrs. Jones had had in cutting or designing felt was\\nwhen she cut out a few pennants for herself and friends at college. Yet with a\\nmodern sewing machine, a pair of good shears, some sharp razor blades and a\\nsmall assortment of felt, she was ready for business. She called on all the\\nsporting goods dealers and sporting goods departments in the city. She told\\nthe managers about her service and asked them to cooperate with her,\\npointing out that they would be rendering their customers a service by\\nsending them to a place which was equipped to design and sew on any sort of\\nletters or emblems wanted on uniforms.\\nMost of the dealers simply send the uniform purchasers to Mrs. Jones and the\\ntransaction thereafter is entirely between her and the uniform owners.\\nHowever, one or two stores prefer to deal with her direct and make a small\\nmargin on the deal. The best season for the little shop, of course, is just prior\\nto opening of the baseball season; but there is always some work to be done\\non swimming suits and both basketball and football create some business.\\nSweater emblems and letters contribute to yearround volume.\\nWith an investment of less than $100, Mrs. Jones earns on an average of\\n$100 per month the year round, with peak months going to about $150. She\\nbelieves the idea would be good in any city where there is no such shop, or\\nwhere there is no uniform factory which provides this service.\\nStarting a Food Specialty BusinessW\\nHILE making bread one morning, it occurred to a widow in New England\\nthat the one thing she liked to do most of all was to bake, and she decided to\\ngive some thought to developing a “Food Specialty Business” in order to add\\nto the family income. The next day she made arrangements with one of the\\nlocal shops to handle her coffee cake and doughnuts and nut bread on a\\ncommission basis. She secured an order from the lunchroom near the station\\nfor a daily order of doughnuts, the first orders being put in on trial. A tea\\nroom which had a rather good business each day—and especially on Sunday\\n—wanted rolls and pies as well as nut bread. These orders were, of course,\\nnot all placed in a day, but as she found a growing demand for her products,\\nand her confidence increased, she had the courage to solicit additional\\nbusiness. Out on the edge of town was a tourist camp which like all such\\nplaces had little facilities for baking. One afternoon she sent her son out on\\nhis bicycle with his basket filled with doughnuts, cookies, pies and coffee\\ncake. It was all sold without difficulty and Johnny came home with orders for\\nmore. All summer long this proved to be a fertile market for her products.\\nThat fall and the winter following, she turned her hand to catering and\\ndeveloped a good business during the “party season.” Occasions such as the\\nhard-times party at the club and a big Halloween party also at the club called\\nfor dozens of doughnuts. She secured both orders simply because the\\ncommittee responsible for the refreshments knew where to get the best\\ndoughnuts in town. That was the secret of her success—everything did taste\\nso good that people came back for more and more. She found that\\ngingerbread was another favorite with the young people in town and she\\nmade a specialty of it by adding a fudge sauce to be poured over the slices.\\nAfter her business had developed, people got in the habit of calling her when\\nunexpected company arrived, and she generally managed to provide\\nsomething delicious that would fill in for a tea or a luncheon or a Sunday\\nnight supper. She remembered that bridge party hostesses liked to serve such\\ndishes as creamed crabmeat and creamed chicken in patty shells. As good\\npatty shells were hard to obtain in their town, she added this item to her list\\nand succeeded in working up a good demand for this specialty by\\nrecommending it for Sunday night suppers as well as bridge parties.“Word of mouth” advertising sold most of her products naturally, but the\\nsmall cards enclosed with her bread, cakes, coffee cakes, and other items\\nhelped to advertise her business. These cards were about three by six and\\ncontained on the reverse side a number of suggestions for special “treats” for\\nluncheon guests, bridge parties, Sunday night suppers and children’s parties.\\nMany a hostess turned these cards over in an emergency and found a happy\\nsolution to “what to give the Joneses after bridge tonight.” The cards were\\ncarefully typewritten by a friend of the family for a small fee. During the\\nChristmas season, Easter, Fourth of July, and other holidays, cards containing\\na list of foods which were especially suitable for holiday parties were mailed\\nto her customers.\\nWhen large orders were received or when a catering order came in, it was, of\\ncourse, necessary to secure extra help. Frequently this was a young woman\\nwho had just completed high school and not having secured a position was\\neager to make a little pin money. Her work was simple and consisted of such\\njobs as icing the little cakes, putting the icing or powdered sugar on the\\ndoughnuts, beating the eggs with the electric beater, putting the cakes or\\ndoughnuts in boxes, washing dishes and pans used in baking, and frequently\\ndelivering special orders when Johnny had too many to handle. The actual\\npreparation of the various specialties was never turned over to anyone else,\\nhowever—the special goodness of these products could not be entrusted to\\nany assistant.\\nFor a woman without business experience this unusual success might seem\\nphenomenal. However, she succeeded because she put into her business what\\neveryone has to put into business if he is to succeed—knowledge, hard work,\\ningenuity, and personality.\\nMaking Money from Worn-Out Tires\\nA\\nMONG the unclaimed goods in James Hadley’s storage warehouse in a\\nmiddle-western town were a number of worn-out tires. He couldn’t collect\\nrental for their storage space, and he couldn’t sell them for more than a fewcents. So when he heard of a machine which made doormats out of the used\\ntires, Hadley decided to investigate.\\n“I had a good many old tires on hand, and if I could make them up into mats,\\nI thought I could get a little profit from them,” explained Mr. Hadley. He\\ninvested three hundred dollars in the mat-making machine and incidental\\nequipment, made up a number of mats, stacked them in his warehouse, and\\nthen advertised them in the local newspapers.\\n“I believed I would sell a number of mats from the advertisement,” said\\nHadley, “but didn’t. There were no crowds clamoring for mats, and I was\\ndisappointed because only a few came to buy. I didn’t sell enough to pay for\\nthe advertising. I reasoned this was because people did not know enough\\nabout the mats, and my problem was to get people acquainted with them. So I\\ntried a window display. But it was hardly noticed. I tried calling from door to\\ndoor, and sold a good many, but I couldn’t down the feeling that there was a\\nbetter market somewhere.”\\nJames Hadley kept thinking about this better market. He went around to\\noffice buildings and talked with managers. They used mats in the entrances of\\nthe buildings, they told him, and admitted his mat was better than the one\\nthey were using, but they were supplied. “I walked my feet off for two\\nweeks,” continued Hadley, “before it occurred to me that I wasn’t using the\\nright kind of merchandising tactics. I changed them. Concentrating my calls\\nupon business concerns, I adopted a policy of leaving a sample mat with each\\nconcern, to be used for a short period. I then pointed out that since the mats\\nwere made from old tires, each mat was much tougher and stronger than an\\nordinary mat, and built up a demonstration to prove the long life of the mats.\\n“One firm, manufacturing twist drills, wasn’t impressed by this argument.\\nThe purchasing agent told me that if the workers operating surface grinders\\npreferred my mat to the one being used, I’d get an order. He put my mat on\\nthe floor in front of a surface grinder. If the solution used in operating\\ngrinders gets on the bare floor accidents are inevitable; so when my mat\\nproved its ability to avoid such accidents, the workers wanted it. Before the\\nday was up, the purchasing agent phoned and asked me to bring over forty-five mats. That cleaned me out of mats and out of tires, too. I got another\\norder for one hundred and thirty feet of mat from a chain of grocery stores the\\nnext day, and had to scour around town to find old tires.”\\nJames Hadley paid five cents each for the old tires, and got an average of\\nthree square feet of matting from each tire. He sold the mats at seventy cents\\na square foot. His total cost including production cost and overhead was\\ntwenty-five cents a square foot, giving him a net profit of forty-five cents.\\nWith the mat-making equipment he was able to turn out three hundred square\\nfeet of matting daily. Operating thus for the first ten months gave Hadley a\\nprofit of more than a thousand dollars.\\nThere is an unlimited field for mats made from old tires in most cities.\\nLaundries, taverns, roadhouses, saloons, cemeteries, churches, office\\nbuildings, machine tool manufacturers, electric power houses, dry cleaning\\nplants, stores, restaurants, printing plants, factories of all kinds, and every\\nhome, are prospects for sales. The mat-making machine is small and operates\\non house electric current from an ordinary light bulb. It may be set up in your\\nbasement, or some unused room. The mats turned out are unusually durable,\\nbeing woven together with heavy spring steel wire.\\nCommunityMarketingofHandicrafts\\nO\\nNE of the difficulties sometimes experienced by those who make things to\\nsell is that they are more or less at the mercy of buyers when it comes to\\nmarketing their products. If there are several people in your community who\\nmake similar things, it may be possible to organize a community marketing\\nagency, with one person acting as an agent for the products of all members.\\nThis, of course, has been done successfully in agricultural communities, and\\nthe idea is beginning to find favor among those who make things that are\\nusually sold through such outlets as gift stores, department stores or\\nwholesalers.\\nA typical organization of this kind is the Willow Cottage Weavers, ofNantucket, Massachusetts. After several members of this group experienced\\ndifficulty in marketing their handicrafts, a central sales department was\\nestablished, which devotes its entire attention to building up and maintaining\\na year-round market for the products of members.\\nDeference to the style factor is most important in holding a clientele which\\nmust be persuaded to pay premium prices for quality products. Next to\\nshortcomings in design, lack of conformity to color trends has been the most\\nserious drawback for many a venture among arts and crafts groups. To\\novercome these serious obstacles, the sales agent for the Willow Cottage\\nWeavers goes scouting several times a year to the style centers to study\\nfashion trends, and more particularly, color preferences. As 95 per cent of the\\noutput is original in design, it is most essential that the merchandise conform\\nto apparel trends to hold customers, many of whom buy on sample.\\nThe direct sales campaign is two-pronged. On the one hand, there is the\\nsolicitation of old customers by mail. This has lately been coupled with a\\n“traveling exhibition” which is counted upon to muster new prospects as well\\nas to contact the old customers in the cities visited. Some of the producers of\\nhand-woven textiles have simplified their display problem by staging\\ndemonstrations in department stores. The head of the Willow Cottage\\norganization prefers an exhibition sale at a hotel, club, vacant store, or other\\nlocation that permits an atmosphere of detachment. Invitations to hand-\\npicked lists are relied upon to coax potential buyers.\\nA second line of attack by the Willow Cottage Weavers is a distinct departure\\nfrom the usual handicraft marketing methods. Several times a year,\\nrepresentatives of the twelve-loom plant visit leading cities to contact interior\\ndecorators and other volume purchasers of hangings, upholstery fabrics, etc.\\nThis plan has been richly productive of new business in sizable units. For\\nexample, a record-breaking order came in for fabrics for a new dormitory at\\nCornell. Because of the demand in modern upholstery and interior decoration\\nfor period designs, most of the work must be done to order to insure color\\nconformity.\\nThese master weavers have found one secret of tying the steady customerswhich seems to have eluded most exploiters of handmade products. This trick\\nis to fill the gap between orders of yardage for suits and coats with specialties\\nsuch as scarfs, neckwear, runners, mats, bureau and dresser sets, etc. In\\naddition to creating many additional orders for the weavers, this activity\\ncultivates gift side lines that, in a sense, serve a sampling purpose in respect\\nto weaves, patterns and color combinations.\\nAn Architect for the Birds\\nT\\nHE name of Joseph H. Dodson is so well known that when you see it you\\nimmediately think of little wren houses swinging from trees or commodious\\napartment houses for martins.\\nThis flourishing business had its beginning years ago when Joseph Dodson\\nworked for a Chicago bond house and much of his spare time was spent in\\nthe basement of his home making bird houses. These little bird houses were\\nunique in that each one had a tiny piece of shiny metal tacked to the outside.\\nHe had discovered that many birds like to primp and preen themselves before\\nmirrors and that by simply attaching this little piece of metal he could entice\\nmore birds to spend their summers with him.\\nBefore long his neighbors began to ask him to make bird houses for them.\\nThen the friends of his neighbors sent in orders and soon he realized that\\nthere were commercial possibilities in this hobby. From this simple beginning\\na good business has developed and today, Joseph Dodson is still making bird\\nhouses and shipping them all over the country from the little town in Illinois\\nwhere he lives. It is an idea that might appeal to you as one way to make that\\n$1,000 we are talking about. There is a good market in nearly every\\ncommunity for “de luxe” bird houses and especially martin houses. They are\\neasy to make and all you need to get started is a clever design and a few\\ntools.\\nBuilding a Business on HomemadeFudgeM\\nRS. BENTLEY , who had a family of four children of school age, found\\nherself faced with the necessity of adding to the family income. Near her\\nhome, in Chicago, was a district zoned for light manufacturing. Girls who\\nworked in these offices liked candy, she reasoned; the men did, too, for that\\nmatter. So she made up a quantity of fudge, wrapped it in cellophane, and\\nmade the rounds of the offices. She sold out her box of fudge before noon the\\nfirst day and scheduled a return the next Tuesday to those offices she had\\ncalled upon. That night she made another batch of fudge and the next\\nmorning called on the offices on the other side of the street with the same\\nresult.\\nIt wasn’t long before she had built up a steady trade. She had divided the\\nzoned section into areas and devoted one half a day to each area. In that way\\npeople in the offices in each area could plan on getting fudge if they wanted it\\non a certain day of the week. The girls—and men—arranged to leave their\\norders at the switchboard and it took but little time to fill them and be ready\\nto go on to the next office.\\nFor special occasions, such as Mother’s Day, Valentine’s Day, parties, week-\\nend trips, anniversaries, hostess gifts, etc., she packed fancy boxes of the\\nfudge, alternating light and dark pieces to form a pattern. She booked orders\\nahead for these boxes and the children delivered them after school.\\nShe had arranged for two school stores and one bakery in the neighborhood\\nto handle her candy and a tea room also gave her space for a small box of\\nfudge which sold at a penny a slice. Through her cousin, who was the cashier\\nin a large cafeteria in the neighborhood, she secured a good display of the\\ncandy on the counter near the cash register. Additional orders came from the\\nteachers in the grade and high schools her children attended. These orders\\namounted to a nice little business, especially at Christmas time when many\\nteachers went home for the holidays and wanted to add several boxes of\\ncandy to their Christmas gifts for the family. Another sales-making idea of\\nMrs. Bentley’s was to put a card bearing the name “Honey Fudge,” her name\\nand address, telephone number, and the price a pound, in each package. Theboxes had to be inexpensive to keep costs down, so she chose plain, deep\\ncream-colored boxes and with a hard brown crayon wrote the words “Honey\\nFudge” in a distinctive backhand script on the covers. A little practice was\\nrequired, of course, to acquire the proper swing to the writing. At first she\\nfound it difficult to get the right pressure when using the crayon on the cover,\\nbut this problem was solved by placing the box cover on a block of smooth\\nwood. A little touch such as this in packaging merchandise often means the\\ndifference between success and failure in marketing your product.\\nWhere to Sell Candied Popcorn\\nS\\nTANDING in a crowd of three hundred and fifty people who stopped to\\nwatch a prairie baseball game, James Barlow, of Waterloo, Iowa, got an idea.\\nBarlow wanted some popcorn and the nearest store was about two blocks\\naway! Here were a hundred or more people all wanting popcorn. What a\\nchance for making money! So he decided to test the possibilities of his idea\\nthe following Sunday. He bought a corn-popper and went to work. His wife’s\\ncookbook furnished a recipe for making caramel from corn syrup and water,\\nand from that recipe Barlow made up a quantity of syrup which he poured\\nover the corn. Then he pressed this caramelized popcorn into balls, wrapping\\neach ball with red waxed tissue. Just before the game began he filled a\\nclothes basket with popcorn balls and carried it into the crowd gathering to\\nwatch the game. Slowly moving up and down the side lines, he soon sold all\\nhis popcorn at five cents a ball, and returned home three times during the\\ngame to refill the basket. His total sales were one hundred and seventy-nine\\npopcorn balls.\\nExpensive equipment is not necessary for successfully caramelizing popcorn.\\nYou may secure satisfactory results by pouring a thin caramel syrup over the\\ncorn shortly after it is popped, and letting it stand for a few minutes. Either\\ncorn syrup or molasses will make a good caramel when mixed with water and\\nboiled. The syrup should be thin, however, so it will spread easily and dry\\nquickly.Popcorn, always a fast selling item, retains its freshness for two or three days,\\nand sells readily wherever people gather to enjoy themselves, such as\\nbeaches, picnics, summer resorts, parks, and tourist camps. Opportunities for\\nquick sales are sometimes found among the crowds who wait outside of\\npublic buildings, fair grounds, and the theaters.\\nOnce you get the “hang” of making the popcorn, you can hire for a small\\ncommission a few “live wire” boys of high school age to help you do the\\nselling and the first thing you know you will have a thriving business. It\\nmeans a little work to get started, but it is more than worth it.\\nIvory Carving Proves Remunerative\\nY\\nEARS ago when Frank Foster of Atlanta, Georgia, was a boy, he learned to\\ncarve ivory. As he grew older it became his hobby and as the years went on\\nhe became more and more expert. Like many skillful arts, ivory carving can\\nbe learned by almost anyone who can handle simple tools. It only requires\\npatience and much practice to become expert.\\nThere are degrees of fineness in ivory carving just as in wood carving. Frank\\nFoster turns out many different kinds of objects, from a plain billiard ball to\\nthe finest, most delicate bit of lacy carving.\\nSince his retirement from business, Frank Foster has built up another\\nbusiness with his unusual hobby. Dominoes, billiard balls, beads, fancy boxes\\nof all types, chessmen, bracelets, earrings, brooches, letter openers, book\\nends, small picture frames, quaint replicas of birds and small animals,\\nfigurines, and of course, elephants of various sizes, all are made by his\\nskillful fingers. His chessmen are particularly beautiful. A fine set of thirty-\\ntwo chessmen brings him from $50 to $75; a de luxe set as much as $250.\\nIvory is rather easy to work with because of its resiliency. The ivory used by\\nMr. Foster is elephant ivory. The tusks cost about $1,000 each, but he\\nmanages to buy scrap ivory around one-tenth the original cost. Pianofactories have hundreds of pounds of material that are useless for making\\npiano keys because the curve in the tusk makes it difficult to secure long\\npieces of ivory. Therefore, the amount from a tusk that can be used for keys\\nis comparatively small. This scrap ivory is of excellent quality and can\\nreadily be used to form small objects.\\nPotato Chips Made Hibbard Independent\\nR\\nOY C. HIBBARD did not relish the long hours and uncertain income driving\\na taxi. He realized he was getting nowhere. So he kept his eyes open for some\\nway to make extra money. He made many stops to pick up fares at beer\\ntaverns, and in this way became acquainted with the tavern owners.\\nSometimes they talked to him about their business in a general way. To make\\npeople drink more beer, he learned, salty food specialties, such as potato\\nchips, were given free to tavern patrons. So Hibbard thought it would be a\\nsmart idea to supply taverns with potato chips.\\nHe obtained a machine that turned out a high quality potato chip, and made\\nup sample packages which he left with each tavern owner he knew. His first\\nsampling produced a total of fifty trial orders. The quality of the chips was\\nexcellent, and the day following he was gratified to secure reorders totaling\\nseventy-five pounds of chips. Hibbard quit his job driving a taxi to devote his\\nentire time to his potato chip business.\\nHibbard’s initial investment was about $100. He bought the machine on a\\ndeferred payment plan, paying $85 for it. Potatoes averaged ninety cents a\\nhundred pounds, and grease for frying cost fourteen cents a pound in twenty\\npound cans. By setting the machine up in the basement of the apartment\\nbuilding where he lived, he had no additional rent to pay. He made good\\nmoney right from the start. His success was in the selection of the right kind\\nof potatoes. At first he used a thin-skinned cobbler, which is inexpensive, but\\nhe later learned that all potatoes do not fry into good chips. The more\\nexpensive Idahos, recommended by the maker of the machine, were found to\\nbe much more satisfactory.Hibbard figures the cost of frying potato chips at nine cents a pound and by\\nbagging them in five-, ten- and twenty-cent sized bags, he averages fifty\\ncents a pound on retail sales. Sales in bulk to taverns bring him thirty cents a\\npound. He averages a net daily profit of better than $11, and his business is\\nsteadily growing.\\nA potato chip machine similar to Hibbard’s can be set up in your own home.\\nIt is operated from gas, and fries potato chips of uniform quality. Ready\\noutlets are found in taverns, lunchrooms and restaurants, and you may\\nwholesale them at fifteen cents a pound to grocery and delicatessen stores.\\nWhen put up in bags, such as the five-cent bags, an additional charge should\\nbe added.\\nDoll Hospital Pays for Operation\\nM\\nOLLY WINDER , the wife of a textile salesman, had been in an automobile\\naccident which had injured her right foot. An operation would cost around\\n$800. How could she get that much money? Of course, there was her\\nhusband’s salary, but payments on a home, insurance premiums and living\\nexpenses, pretty well used all of that. Mrs. Winder had often dressed dolls at\\nChristmas time for her friends’ children from the textile samples discontinued\\nby her husband from his line. Perhaps making doll clothes was the answer.\\nShe found her friends quite willing to buy the doll clothes for their children’s\\nbirthdays and as gifts. Her doll clothes sold quickly because she patterned\\nthem after the current styles in women’s and children’s clothes. A doll\\ndressed in the current fashion always makes a hit with children. She had\\nstarted to make the doll clothes in September and in November and\\nDecember she concentrated on getting as much business as possible for the\\nChristmas season. It was at this time that she found herself not only dressing\\ndolls for Christmas, but also mending them. The dolls brought in by the\\nmothers would have a broken arm or leg, a scratch on the face, a cracked\\nhead or a badly torn wig. Of course, these damages would have to be repaired\\nbefore the doll could be dressed.It was easy for her to make these simple repairs. A little glue here, a bit of\\nsewing there, the wig recurled and the new clothes would make “Betsy Ann”\\nor “Sally Lou” look brand new again. Molly Winder is the genial type of\\nwoman who has a large circle of friends and acquaintances and almost before\\nshe realized it, the word had gone around and she was in the Doll Hospital\\nbusiness. However, she did not stop at repairing dolls—toys of all kinds were\\nbrought to her to mend and even china and little pieces of brica-brac. She also\\nfound—perhaps “cultivated” would be a better word—a market for character\\ndolls and dolls dressed in the costumes of the various nations. These dolls\\nwere raffled at church bazaars and charity affairs held by societies, lodges,\\netc.\\nBy the following June, Molly was able to make arrangements for her\\noperation. She had enough money to pay the hospital bill and more than half\\nof the doctor bill, Now that she had built up a good list of customers, the\\nsecond Christmas was so profitable the work required all her time and she\\ndelegated the household activities to her eldest daughter of highschool age.\\nMrs. Winder was fortunate, of course, in that she had most of the materials\\nneeded in her work and but little money had to be spent for supplies.\\nHowever, even with the added expense for materials, operating a community\\nhospital for dolls can be made a profitable venture.\\nBrown Bread and Beans Pay the Taxes\\nT\\nHE woman who lives in or near a section of apartment dwellers will\\ngenerally find a market near her home for breads, cookies, cakes and similar\\nproducts if she but searches her neighborhood for prospects. One woman\\nliving on Chicago’s south side developed a market for brown bread and\\nbaked beans by calling on homes in her neighborhood on Friday afternoons.\\nMany homes that serve baked beans, creamed codfish and similar Friday\\nfoods, find that brown bread is just the needed item to make a perfect meal.\\nHowever, most women will not bother to make brown bread and it is one of\\nthose special foods that the commercial food firms have not been able toreproduce with all its fine flavor.\\nShe started out with the idea of selling brown bread only but the tie-up with\\nbaked beans was so obvious, it was not long before she was selling both. Her\\nmethod of introducing the brown bread was to carry a small case similar to a\\ntypewriter case containing several whole loaves of brown bread and one\\nsliced loaf. The slices which had been cut in half were offered to each\\nprospective customer as a sample. The bread was exceptionally good as the\\nsample proved and before long she had several Friday customers. The baked\\nbeans were deliciously brown and put up in brown earthenware of two sizes,\\nsmall and large, depending upon the size of the family ordering. Most of the\\nwomen welcomed the idea of a home-cooked meal without any of the fuss of\\npreparation. They could arrive home from their bridge parties, put the pot of\\nbeans in the oven to warm, slice the bread, fix up a substantial salad, bring\\nout the pickles and catsup and serve the dessert prepared in the morning\\nbefore leaving for the party.\\nBeing a wide-awake person, this woman made up a list of foods with which\\nbrown bread tasted good, such as baked beans, codfish, potato salad, finnan\\nhaddie, etc. She also suggested it for the children’s lunches with a big glass\\nof milk, as well as sliced, cut in circles or other fancy shapes, and spread with\\ncheese, to serve at luncheons and parties. Her name, address and telephone\\nnumber were typed by her daughter in high school on regular recipe-size\\ncards and a list of the ways of using brown bread was typed on the back of\\nthe card together with prices. These cards were mailed to friends of\\ncustomers (names she secured simply by asking for them), given to prospects\\nwho had shown an interest in her products, and to customers. She also mailed\\nthem to tenants in the buildings where she had customers. Incidentally, she\\nnever missed an opportunity to call on other tenants in a building where a\\ncustomer lived.\\nIn addition to this type of business she opened up another field for her brown\\nbread by calling upon the three hotels in the immediate vicinity, as well as\\nselling four other hotels in an adjacent neighborhood that catered to more or\\nless permanent guests who were fussy about their food. Her high school\\ndaughter and 12-year-old son delivered the orders near home while sheherself drove the old family car and delivered the hotel orders and other\\norders outside her immediate neighborhood. As the business grew she began\\nto put aside a tidy little sum of money which paid the taxes on her home each\\nyear and helped to dress the children as well as herself.\\nHe Made “Snake Snaks” Popular\\nS\\nEVERAL years ago George K. End, of Arcadia, Florida, helped his two\\nsmall sons kill a rattlesnake and skin it. The reptile’s flesh, which was a pale,\\nsalmon pink, looked inviting and Mr. End decided to taste it as an\\nexperiment. To his surprise he found that it had a delicate flavor and was\\nexceedingly tender. Sometime later he served the meat at a convention at\\nTampa and those who tried it agreed that it was delicious. A number of\\nfriends also tried it on his recommendation and pronounced it a real delicacy.\\nHe decided that there might be a market for the product and as the immediate\\nvicinity has more rattlesnakes to the square mile than any other part of the\\nUnited States, he had an unlimited meat supply for his odd business. He\\nestablished a canning plant and started to prepare and market his product.\\nThe main difficulty, of course, was overcoming the prejudice people have\\nabout eating snakes. However, Mr. End found enough people who considered\\nhis product a delicacy to enable him to build up a good-sized business.\\nPeople eat eels, snails, and frog legs, so why not clean, palatable snake meat,\\na product much cleaner than the oyster which so many people enjoy?\\nThe snakes are captured alive by means of a noose at the end of a bamboo\\npole about six feet long, then they are swung into a wire cage and taken to the\\ncannery. Here they are killed the same day if possible, as they will not eat in\\ncaptivity and, consequently, lose considerable weight. The snake catchers are\\npaid at the rate of twenty cents a foot averaging about $1.25 a snake. The\\nmeat is prepared with or without a sauce and orders for raw rattlesnake meat\\nare also filled. The average snake weighs about nine pounds when brought in\\nbut much of this weight is lost through shrinkage in cooking and with the\\nremoval of the head, bones and rattles. Not cheap by any means, the meatsells for $1.25 for a four and one-half ounce can; the uncooked meat bringing\\n$2.50 a pound. The meat is also smoked in the same fashion ham is smoked\\nand marketed as “Snake Snaks” in small bags. In view of the fact that the\\nmeat has a very delicate flavor, it is especially delicious served as canapes.\\nOther parts of the rattler such as the head, the rattles, the fangs are made up\\ninto ornaments and a rubbing oil is made from the fatty tissues. The skin, of\\ncourse, is made into hat bands, belts, pocketbooks, book covers, etc.\\nYou may not be keen about the idea of starting a snake cannery, even though\\nyou live in a snake infested area. However, the way Mr. End made his $1,000\\nmay suggest to you the many opportunities for making money that exist right\\nin your own back yard, so to speak, if only you look for them.\\nWhat You Can Make from Clam Shells\\nM\\nARY COOPER , who lived with her two small children in a cheap rooming\\nhouse, had lost her job. However, being an ingenious person, she had soon\\nestablished herself in a nice little business of her own making novelties from\\nclam and oyster shells. She secured the shells without cost from a near-by sea\\nfood shop and made them up into novelties. She took them down to the\\nbeauty parlor where she had been working and the owner of the shop gave\\nher display space in a window for a commission on all that were sold. Such\\nnovelties are inexpensive to make. The materials used consist of common\\npipe cleaners, clam, oyster shells, and other shells. No particular skill is\\nrequired. Here is how to do it:\\nDrill a hole in the small end of an oyster shell. Insert one end of a pipe\\ncleaner through this hole and fasten it securely by twisting the wire over and\\naround the edge of the shell, letting most of the pipe cleaner extend upward.\\nNow repeat this operation with a second oyster shell of the same size. Place\\nthe two shells alongside each other. Halfway up the length of the pipe\\ncleaners, bend and twist them together for the rest of their length. Next select\\ntwo small oyster shells. Match and fit them together about the twisted single\\nportion of the pipe cleaners. That portion of the pipe cleaners which protrudesabove the shells becomes a neck. Now drill a hole in one side of a small\\nconical shell. Attach this to the top of the pipe cleaner. You now have the\\nfigure of a comical man, with two large feet made from oyster shells, a body\\nmade from oyster shells, and the legs and neck from the pipe cleaners. The\\nsmall shell on top is, of course, the head. Arms may be added by cutting a\\npipe cleaner in half, and attaching to the neck at the juncture of the oyster\\nshells. A small brush and ten cents’ worth of paint will enable you to tint\\nyour figures any color. Ash trays and a score of useful items may be easily\\nmade in this way.\\nTosdale Sisters Saw Paris on FancyPillows\\nT\\nHE Tosdale sisters had just finished college, and after the usual round of\\nparties had been given for them in their home town, they developed a bad\\ncase of wanderlust. Somehow or other Helen and Mary Tosdale meant to\\nmake some money for a trip.\\nThere was one thing in which both girls excelled and that was sewing. Both\\nof them had made all their dresses and many of their suits and coats since\\ntheir high-school days. They knew colors and fabrics and they had style\\nsense. However, neither one of the girls had any desire to develop a\\ndressmaking trade. It would have to be some other type of sewing, they\\ndecided. And then they hit on the idea of fancy pillows. The years of sewing\\nin the Tosdale home had resulted in trunks and boxes of both used and\\nunused fabrics and ribbons and edgings. After a check-up, they found they\\nwould have enough for quite a number of pillows before they would have to\\nbuy any new material.\\nThat summer they worked over pillow designs and by November, they had\\nmade several dozen unusual and beautiful pillows. Ribbons in matching tones\\nwere woven together to make interesting squares; bands of contrasting\\nmaterial were appliqued in modern effects; porch pillows were made of\\nsturdy chintz and cretonne, their edges bound in contrasting colors; fine\\nlinens were daintily embroidered to fashion baby pillows of softest down;scraps of lace and silks were used to make boudoir pillows, and jewel-colored\\nsquares of velvet and satin were trimmed with looped fringe edgings or with\\npipings of a contrasting material to make plain, tailored cushions.\\nThree weeks before Christmas they were ready to display their work. They\\npersuaded a local laundry agent to rent them his window space for the three\\nweeks for five dollars. After the mad Christmas rush was over, they found\\nthat they had sold every pillow they had made up and had orders for about\\ntwo dozen more to fill. They charged good prices, too. As a matter of fact,\\nthey discovered that people seem to appreciate handwork in direct proportion\\nto the price.\\nWhile a handsome profit was made on the Christmas sale there wasn’t\\nenough money in the travel fund to take them both to Europe that year. So\\nthey designed, and planned, and sewed all spring and summer. The\\nmagazines were scanned for ideas, and the silk sales eagerly watched for\\nbargains. They managed to buy a lot of kapok and down-filled pillows in\\nmuslin covers from a wholesaler at a price cheaper than they could make\\nthem. During the spring, the two girls had orders from a half dozen local\\nfamilies for pillows and draperies and they sold pillows steadily through the\\nsummer for porch use. One of the local gift shops gave them an order for\\npillows which the proprietor admitted were more attractive and better styled\\nthan any she could purchase elsewhere.\\nLate that fall they worked busily to get enough stock ready for the Christmas\\nsale. They figured that even if they made too many they could be sold during\\nthe next year. By the time the Christmas season arrived they had more\\npillows than the laundry agent’s window could hold. So a vacant store on a\\nbusy street was secured for a month and it was so attractively arranged that\\npeople came in just to look around. The majority of them, however, evidently\\nleft with pillows under their arms, because when two tired girls figured up\\ntheir sales after the last mad scramble Christmas eve, they found only two\\npillows left, one of which had been stepped on and soiled and the other\\nwedged behind a counter out of sight.\\nSo the Tosdale sisters saw Europe the next year and evidently it won’t betheir last trip for they have decided to open up a shop. Now that they have an\\nidea of what people want, their shop will carry pillows, curtains, quilts,\\npadded throws for the chaise lounge, pads for dresser drawers and shelves,\\npadded dress hangers, equipment for wardrobes and closets, etc. To have\\nenough stock on hand, they have secured the part-time services of two\\nwomen who do exquisite needlework.\\nMakes Miniature Reproductions ofAntiques\\nV\\nISITING George Cona’s shop in San Francisco is like traveling with\\nGulliver through the land of Lilliput. Time and space are eliminated by this\\ncraftsman’s wand as he fashions miniature models of antique furniture. In\\norderly rows above his workbench, hang diminutive planes and saws, and\\ntiny little hammers that drive still tinier nails into bits of wood of matchlike\\nthickness.\\nWith these tools Mr. Cona fashions tiny cabinets no higher than an orange.\\nEvery detail is finished with minute precision even to the lining of the\\ndrawers, for no cabinet-maker ever delved more intensively into furniture\\nlore or applied his knowledge with closer attention to authenticity.\\nAs a boy in England, Mr. Cona studied period furniture and cultivated his\\ntalent for reproducing it. Later, in California when his health failed after\\nmany years in the ministry, he turned to cabinet making for a livelihood.\\nThere were fat years during which he became notable in San Francisco for\\nantique furniture reproductions so clever that only an expert could tell the\\ncopy from the original. Then came 1929 and lean years. He was past three\\nscore and ten, yet his agile fingers still held their cleverness. When business\\nlanguished he turned to his hobby—the modeling in miniature of\\nChippendale chairs, Duncan Phyfe tables and Heppelwhite sideboards. Of\\ncourse, this does not mean doll furniture. These bits of furniture are real\\nminiatures. To give a cash basis of differentiation—a Cona bedroom set sells\\nfor $5; a doll’s set of similar proportions for 25 cents.Former patrons straggling in with odd jobs noticed the exquisite little models\\nand bought them. They sent friends who “wanted a set just like it.” Gradually\\na little furniture business filled the big furniture void. One day a woman with\\na pre-depression bank balance asked Mr. Cona if he could build a doll house\\nto fit the furniture. The answer was yes, Mr. Cona having studied architecture\\nalong with antiques in England. He drew plans and built a house that clicked\\nand brought more orders. Now he makes to order houses that, as he puts it,\\nare “just a little better.” These range from a $10 cottage for a real estate firm\\nto a $300 mansion for a wealthy client’s child.\\nJust now he is working on a house complete with furniture that will bring\\n$550. The house stands in his window and the furniture is being added piece\\nby piece as finished. Every day interested observers pause before the shop\\nwindow to ascertain the progress made. The five-room colonial house is\\nwhite with green trimmings. It has parquetry floors of oak and mahogany and\\na delightful oak staircase, with banisters, that leads to the bath and bedrooms\\nabove. The rooms contain electric switches of postage stamp size and the\\nchandeliers are fitted with tiny globes. The finely wrought window frames\\nenclose real glass windows instead of the usual mica.\\nThe interest in miniature reproductions of antique furniture during the past\\nfew years has been largely stimulated by the exhibit of Mrs. Ward Thorne’s\\nexquisite miniature rooms at the Chicago World’s Fair, and by the $500,000\\ndoll house exhibited for charity by the moving picture actress, Colleen\\nMoore. Another beautiful example of this work is the priceless collection of\\nHelena Rubinstein, the well-known cosmetic manufacturer. Some of the tiny\\nlittle furnishings of these rooms have been acquired by their owners during\\nyears of collecting little objects of glass, brass, wood, and bits of furniture.\\nHowever, most of them have been made by modern craftsmen. Many a man\\nwith a workbench in his basement and a flair for design can turn out these\\ntiny bits of furniture. Books and periodicals on furniture design will help him\\nin getting the lines of the tiny pieces of furniture as authentic as the originals.\\nA Rattling Good Income from RattlersC\\nATHERINE C. REIDY , of Tucson, Arizona, became interested in snakes\\nwhile homesteading twenty-three miles from the town where Mr. Reidy\\nworked. She began studying the local wild life and vegetation as a pastime\\nand became so interested that she started to write on nature subjects. This\\nmeant getting together more or less of a reference library, cameras and other\\nequipment. Then the depression came along and slashed the family income\\nrather badly. She wrote a few letters and found herself engaged to collect\\nbugs for several biological supply houses. She also sold cactus and wild\\nflower seed.\\nIt was while collecting notes on native foods of the Indians that she found the\\nIndians not only use the meat of the rattlers for food, but they made\\nornamental necklaces from the bones. This aroused her curiosity and the next\\ntime she captured a rattler, she popped him into a kettle and the next day she\\nhad a business. The ornaments include costume jewelry, buttons, buckles,\\nnecklaces and bracelets. “The bones,” explains Mrs. Reidy, “resemble carved\\nivory, and achieve a startling whiteness after a lengthy cleansing and\\nbleaching process. They are then matched carefully and strung in various\\nways, some naturally and some in combination with colored beads of many\\nkinds and sizes.” The rattlers’ skins make lovely billfolds, bookmarks,\\ncigarette cases, check-book holders, pocketbooks and even boots and jackets.\\nDuring the Chicago World’s Fair, a tailored suit of rattlesnake skins made by\\nMrs. Reidy was displayed in the Arizona exhibit, and attracted a tremendous\\namount of attention.\\nBusiness became so good, the Reidys moved back to town and fitted up a\\nstudio where their handicraft could be displayed more easily. She now has\\nseveral hunters to secure the snakes and has put in a stock of meat. She has\\nfound that there is always a small demand for the skulls and fangs and the\\nrattles. In addition to maintaining the studio, Mrs. Reidy exhibits her wares at\\ntourist camps and dude ranches in the West.\\nHe Specialized in “Hamburgers”A\\nFEW years ago, Henry Fisher lost his job in a restaurant. He took fifty\\ndollars from his small savings account, rented space in a Chicago Loop office\\nbuilding, and opened up a hamburger shop. In three months, Henry’s\\nbusiness became so profitable, he opened two more shops, which he now\\noperates successfully.\\n“The space secured for my first location was hardly big enough to turn\\naround in,” he said. “I hoped to be able to get additional space later, add a\\nregular line of restaurant food, and serve coffee, tea and milk. But I decided\\nagainst this policy during my first week and specialized in hamburger\\nsandwiches. These were a little larger than ordinary, and I sold them for a\\ndime. People working in the building crowded around at noon, and it was at\\nonce apparent that they wanted quick service more than anything else. As\\nnews of my stand got around the building, I had considerable difficulty\\nkeeping up with the crowd’s demand during the noon hour.\\n“My investment in equipment amounted to sixteen dollars. Rent for the six-\\nby-ten-foot space was thirty-three dollars a month. I did no advertising. I\\nhadn’t figured on it, for I hadn’t planned on staying in that small space very\\nlong. As I was serving a better hamburger sandwich for a dime (one covered\\nwith relish in which a little mayonnaise dressing was mixed on a rye bun—\\nsometimes known as ‘Vienna’ style), they sold themselves. On my first day, I\\ntook in twenty-four dollars. My expenses ran to fifteen. The second day was a\\nlittle better and by the end of the week, I figured I was on my way. My wife,\\nwho was as excited over the success of this first stand as I was, urged me not\\nto be satisfied with one location, but to open a second stand. However, we\\nhad difficulty finding a spot for it, since few office buildings had suitable\\nspace available and those having such space wanted too much for it. So we\\nchose a small room on the second floor of an industrial building which was\\nalmost entirely devoted to the printing industry. One typesetting company\\nemployed a hundred and twenty men, and a printing company occupying two\\nfloors employed six hundred men and girls. Our success in this spot was\\nimmediate. The workers patronized us because we were convenient and gave\\nthem a satisfying sandwich for a dime, which was about all many wanted topay for a lunch. Those who didn’t want to leave their shop or office, often\\nasked someone to bring back a hamburger. Office and errand boys from the\\noffices in the building take back as many as fifteen or twenty hamburgers for\\nthe girls and men in their office at one time. I could have sold coffee at our\\nfirst location, but that would have meant a delay in service. People who want\\ncoffee generally want to sit down at a table and I didn’t have room for tables\\nthere. Those who bought the hamburgers didn’t seem to mind not having\\ncoffee. So I saved the rental on larger space and the cost of fixtures, and did\\njust as big a business as if I had them. In the second shop, however, we sold\\ncoffee, because it seemed to be a custom for working men to send out a boy\\nfor enough coffee for eight or ten at one time. Our profits in this building\\nwere almost as large as in the first place. When I decided to open the third\\nlocation, I chose a spot in another industrial building. Here rent was cheap,\\nand there was a large and highly concentrated market for coffee and\\nhamburgers.”\\nHenry pointed out that he did not consider locations outside of the business or\\nindustrial districts as suitable for hamburger stands. His success, he declares,\\nwas due to offering a convenience to working people with limited time. If he\\ncan get 30 per cent of the workers in a building, he is able to keep one stand\\ngoing in great shape, and have the evening for himself.\\nHis first equipment was one second-hand griddle, thirty by eighteen inches,\\nfor frying the hamburgers, a large tin box for his supply of “giant” rolls, and a\\nlarge bottle of relish. A trick in making hamburgers especially delicious is to\\nmix the meat with crumbled stale bread. No ice is required since the\\nhamburgers come ready for the griddle on two daily deliveries from the local\\npacking house warehouses. A stand of this kind may be opened with very\\nlittle capital in any small space on the lower floors (not necessarily the lobby\\nor street floor) of an industrial or office building. Potato chips bagged, small\\npies, and similar specialties might profitably be carried as side lines.\\nEtched Bottles and Boxes Sell Easily\\nWHEN Harry Brown finished college, he decided to see if he couldn’t make\\nsome money with an idea he had been mulling over for some time. In his\\nchemistry course in college he had learned how to etch glass by coating it\\nwith beeswax, lettering words with a steel point, and then exposing the\\nsurface of the glass to the fumes of hydrofluoric acid. With a little practice\\nHarry found that he could produce some rather\\nneat looking bottles suitable for the medicine cabinet. He purchased a carton\\nof standard-sized bottles of good clear glass and etched them with the names\\nof the usual medicine cabinet remedies such as boric acid, witch hazel, hand\\nlotion, glycerin, etc. He made up several sets of four bottles each and sold\\nthem to friends and relatives. Later he sold them from house to house. On\\nevery call he tried to sell a complete set of bottles. However, when it was\\nplainly evident that the housewife did not need the entire set, he would\\nsuggest her taking a pair of bottles. Sometimes he could get her to suggest\\nother labels for two more which he would etch for no additional charge. He\\nalso took orders for special sets of bottles for the invalid in the family or for\\nthe baby’s medicines.\\nHarry made it a point to deliver the orders in the evening. Generally, the\\n“man of the house” would be home and there would be no delay in getting\\nthe money for his work. Furthermore, he frequently found that father would\\nbe interested in securing for his “private supply,” a uniform set of bottles\\nwith names such as Rye, Bourbon, Scotch, etc.\\nAnother idea that sold well was a little mirrored-top match box. He bought\\nthese by the dozen and etched numbers from one to eight on the mirrored\\ntops. Women bridge fans were delighted with them as they could use them\\nfor bridge prizes. When these went over so big, he purchased some larger\\nmirrored cigarette boxes and etched the names of the popular cigarette brands\\non the tops. Women bought these novelties for bridge prizes also as well as\\nfor their own homes.\\nBefore long, Harry found himself so busy that he not only had to secure\\nassistance in handling the work of etching the bottles, but also had to hire\\nsomeone to follow up inquiries.TheVogueforWroughtIron HouseNumbers\\nW\\nHEN the depression took away his office job, Leander Hvale of Deerfield,\\nIllinois, turned to his hobby, the making of hand-wrought knickknacks for\\nhomes. Word-of-mouth advertising along the fashionable North Shore section\\nhas brought Mr. Hvale many orders for handmade iron home-markers\\n(swinging signs at the gate or on posts near the entrance), wall plaques,\\nweather vanes and other handicraft. His son, a Chicago Art Institute graduate,\\nmakes the designs. One home-marker, which he worked out for a dog shelter\\n(an enterprise of one of Chicago’s society leaders), shows a little dog up on\\nhis hind legs, begging. Two other little dogs are sympathetically listening.\\nAnother design was a lovely madonna for the wall of an outdoor living-room\\nof a North Shore estate.\\nThe home-marker had its origin in the Middle Ages before the invention of\\nhouse numbers. In order to identify one’s home it was customary to use some\\nsort of distinctive sign. Thus people came to speak of Mr. So-and-So who\\nlived at the sign of the “Green Rooster” or the “Yellow Lantern.” Among the\\nnobility the crests from the family coat-of-arms were used as home-markers.\\nFighting cocks, spread eagles and unicorns were popular. The modern vogue\\nof naming homes has brought with it the demand for markers to symbolize\\nhospitality and good-fellowship.\\nMr. Hvale realized that he would have to let people know what he could do\\nwith wrought iron if he were to have any kind of success. So, although he had\\nno money to spare, he planned to have an exhibit at the Garden Club flower\\nshow held at Chicago’s Navy Pier. The money for the display space was\\nearned by doing odd chores and shoveling peat for a month for the club. The\\ndisplay did bring his work to the attention of those who appreciate the beauty\\nof wrought iron and created no little business.\\nThere are any number of things to be made of wrought iron and those who\\nhave a hankering for this type of work will find innumerable designs in books\\non the subject. The wrought iron gates and balconies of New Orleans, madein the colonial days, are known all over the world for their beauty. For years\\nthese examples of art and skill have endured. The intricate, lacy designs are\\nreally the work of artists and are not easy to equal. However, there are many\\nsimpler designs which can be made by the average craftsman. Home-\\nmarkers, colonial lanterns for entrance lights, railings, small balconies\\nbeneath windows, fireplace equipment, grills, hinges, door knockers—all are\\nin vogue today due to the revival of interest in colonial architecture and\\nfurnishings. Prices charged for wrought iron things should, of course, be high\\nenough to put a proper value on original design and expert craftsmanship of\\nthis sort.\\nJames Mack’s Sandwich Bar\\nF\\nOUR years ago, James Mack, in search of a better climate for his health,\\ndrove to Florida and stopped for a while in Miami. Now James Mack was a\\nconnoisseur of good coffee. He was fussy about the kind of coffee he drank,\\nand well he might be for he made a good cup of coffee himself. According to\\nMack, there was no good coffee in Miami. He tried all the restaurants, the\\nhotels, and even the refreshment stands. The coffee was terrible!\\nWell, if he couldn’t get a good cup of coffee in Miami, he would make it\\nhimself and show these Florida cooks how the people from up north liked\\ntheir coffee! No sooner said than done—James Mack opened up a sandwich\\nbar. The menu included only two types of sandwiches—fish and hamburger\\n—and the best coffee you could buy at any price. Yet he charged only a\\nnickel a cup for it. Milk was added to the menu as a concession to those who\\ncouldn’t drink coffee. The fish used in the sandwiches was always whatever\\nwas in the market that morning in quantities sufficient to be purchased at a\\ngood price. The hamburger was always strictly fresh and prepared so that it\\nreally was good enough to accompany the best cup of coffee in town. No pie,\\nno cake, no cookies, no ham and eggs—nothing but the sandwiches and\\ncoffee and milk were served.\\nPeople were skeptical at first, but the few who tried his coffee were backsoon with other customers. It became the habit to brag to newcomers, “I’ll\\ntake you over to Mack’s where you will get the best cup of coffee you ever\\ntasted.” There were seats for only twelve at Mack’s place and he refused to\\nenlarge. “I don’t want a great big place with lots of overhead,” he remarked\\nto a visitor who asked him why he didn’t enlarge the place. “The customers\\nreally like it this way—it’s cozy and different from the average restaurant or\\nhotel dining room. If I enlarged and had to have waitresses and tables, the\\nplace would look like every other food ‘emporium.’”\\nPeople did like it as it was—they stood four deep in line to get their coffee,\\nand thought it fun. They ate their dinners at the hotels and came over to\\nMack’s for their coffee. It became a fad and he was wise enough to know it\\nand to keep it so. Once he had made his reputation for having the best coffee\\nin town, he did nothing to change it. That coffee had to be good! He bought\\nthe berries himself, blended them, and ground the coffee fresh each time it\\nwas prepared. The few things he served were all fresh and good quality. The\\nplace was immaculate and so was Mack and his assistant in their white coats.\\nThere was no noisy clatter of dishes and silverware—the service was quiet,\\nthe place cool and shaded from the sun by awnings. Mack was proud of his\\ncoffee and sandwiches—he expected you to enjoy them, and you did.\\nMack’s emphasis on quality succeeded. He has turned in his old car on a new\\none, paid his doctor bills back up north, improved his place, paid for all his\\nequipment, and has money in the bank!\\nDoughnutsBringProfits\\nU\\nPON leaving his job in the circulation department of a Chicago newspaper,\\nS. D. Lavely retired to Watervliet, Michigan. Idleness soon palled on him,\\nand he decided to start a small business of his own. He rented a store and\\ninvested $250 in equipment for making greaseless doughnuts. The first batch\\nof doughnuts baked was given away as samples to people passing the store.\\nThat first day Lavely sold seventy dozen doughnuts at twenty-five cents a\\ndozen. The second day went even better as a majority of those who boughtthe first day repeated, and brought others with them.\\nBefore the first week passed, Lavely had reached an average daily sale of\\nover 150 dozen—all he could bake. He expanded his business and added\\nmore equipment. As Watervliet is but a short drive from Paw Paw Lake,\\nLavely figured he could do a brisk business with the summer resorts around\\nPaw Paw. So he hired a woman to help his wife bake doughnuts while he\\npacked sixty dozen in his car and drove down to the lake. Within two hours\\nhe sold the entire lot to vacationists in cottages. After that he drove down to\\nthe lake at least once every day. Later, he established a regular route to the\\nnear-by towns of Marcellus, Lawrence, and Hartford, where he sold the\\ndoughnuts at wholesale for fifteen cents a dozen to most of the restaurants,\\nretail stores, tea rooms, soda fountains and lunchrooms.\\nThe cost of baking greaseless doughnuts averages under six cents a dozen\\nwith the equipment Lavely used. His small machine bakes eight dozen in an\\nhour, or eighty dozen in a ten-hour day. Lavely started with two of these\\nmachines, giving him a daily output of 160 dozen doughnuts. During the first\\nweek, his sales totaled 900 dozen at twenty-five cents a dozen. When he had\\ndeducted all his expenses he found that he had made quite a nice little profit\\n—about $161.\\nGreaseless doughnuts are baked in electrically operated bakers. They are not\\nfried like ordinary doughnuts. The doughnut batter used is exactly the same\\nas is used when baking the “greasy” doughnut. When packed in waxed paper\\ncontainers, greaseless doughnuts remain fresh for six to eight days. This type\\nof doughnut is quite easily digested and may be eaten without harm even by\\nchronic stomach sufferers.\\nEquipment for baking greaseless doughnuts may be set up in your own\\nkitchen and operated from a light socket. Demand for this product is always\\ngood, and stores, lunchrooms, and restaurants are excellent outlets. You may\\nretail some to your friends and neighbors, as Lavely did, and before you\\nknow it you will have a thriving business of your own. It has the great\\nadvantage of being a business where satisfied customers draw others. The\\naverage American takes to doughnuts like a duck takes to the water, and itdoes not take the people in town long to make a beaten path to the door of the\\nman who can make better doughnuts.\\nMotor-DrivenChairsforInvalids\\nL\\nUZERN CUSTER , of Dayton, Ohio, makes motor-driven chairs for people\\nwho are incapacitated—invalids or cripples. His plant, in Dayton, turns out\\nabout three chairs a week, at an average price of $200 a chair. Until recently,\\nall the chairs were driven by electric batteries. Now, however, some of them\\nhave gasoline motors and will run along at 15 miles an hour. Some of these\\nchairs have built-in showcases to enable their users to sell candy or notions.\\nOne Southerner had a chair built to carry himself and his Negro attendant.\\nMany of the cripples for whom he makes chairs like gay colors, so he paints\\ntheir chairs fire-engine red and equips them with powerful headlights and\\nloud horns.\\nTwenty years ago Mr. Custer started to make chairs for board walks. Putting\\nmotors in them revolutionized the business for him and he made good money\\nfor several years. Then he saw a market for motor-driven chairs for invalids\\nand the incapacitated. It wasn’t long before most of his business was catering\\nto this market.\\n100 Other Things Easy to Make\\nW\\nOOD— Start with the simpler things such as book ends, a bookstand, bird\\nhouses, garden trellises, picture frames, racks for garden tools, window\\nboxes, footstools, flower stands. When you have developed some skill and\\nease in handling tools, try folding screens, end tables, cupboards, hanging\\nbookshelves, coffee tables, toys, etc. The modern style of furniture is simple\\nand easy to make. Keep clear of elaborate ornamentation which does not add\\nto the design of the product. There is also a good demand for the rustic typeof lawn and garden furniture. This furniture is made of small logs and\\nbranches upon which the bark is left. The construction is simple in the\\nextreme. Blueprints can be had from such magazines as Popular Science\\nMonthly, Popular Mechanics, and the government.\\nc eMent—It requires much less skill to make things of cement than of wood.\\nForms of wood or metal may be bought or you can make them yourself.\\nThere are government bulletins explaining how to mix and use the cement;\\nthe cement companies will also send you instructions. Get a catalog from\\nsome company making this type of product and see just what items are in\\ndemand. Bird baths, sun dials, aquariums, benches, urns or large jardinieres,\\nand other garden and lawn equipment are popular. When you have acquired\\nsome skill, you can also make clever little figures and ornaments such as\\nfrogs and mermaids for the lily pond; rabbits and squirrels for the lawn;\\nfauns, birds, etc.\\np aper—So many things can be made with paper it is almost impossible to\\nenumerate them. With pastepot and shears, or shears alone, clever hands can\\nfashion an endless number of things that can be sold in the gift shops, in your\\nown shop, from door to door, or at fairs and exhibits. One of the most\\ninteresting things to do with paper is to make silhouettes. There are books on\\nsilhouette making and many magazine articles have covered this art. With\\npractice and a certain dexterity, you can make a good living with this work.\\nThe usual practice is to set up your worktable in a gift shop, a department\\nstore, a greeting card shop, a county fair, a street fair, or any place where\\nmany people congregate. The silhouettes are sold at from 50 cents to $1.00\\neach. Double your paper and cut two of them at once. Then offer them to the\\ncustomer at two for 75 cents or two for $1.25, depending upon your price per\\nsilhouette. A little “showmanship” will add to your sales. With wall paper\\nyou can create some beautiful folding screens—look over those on display in\\nyour local department store. You can also make closet accessories from\\nboxes and wall paper— hat boxes, blanket boxes, shoe boxes, etc. These\\nshould be matched, or ensembled. With wall paper you can also make\\nscrapbook covers, cover waste-paper baskets, tin cooky boxes, cigarette\\nboxes, etc. These should be shellacked when finished to protect the paper.\\nMany decorators have had unusual success with cutting designs from wallpaper and making an applique border for bathroom, kitchen or bedroom\\nwalls. These borders can also be used to decorate kitchen cabinets, bread\\nboxes and other containers, valances for windows, etc. Colored cut-outs of\\nanimals, fairy tale characters, fruit, flowers, etc., can be made for children’s\\nrooms, as wall or furniture decorations. Make these in sets, put them in\\nglassine envelopes and sell them for 50 cents and up a set. With crepe paper\\nyou can make fascinating favors and decorations for parties. The Dennison\\nCompany’s party books will give you directions for making favors, party\\ndecorations, and paper costumes.\\no Ilcloth—Oilcloth may be used in much the same way as wall paper. It is\\nexcellent to cover folding screens (especially for kitchen or nursery use), to\\ncover boxes, to cover scrapbooks and schoolbooks, as cut-outs for wall and\\ncupboard decorations, for valances, etc. In addition, oilcloth makes attractive\\nbreakfast and luncheon sets for the summer cottage, table mats for children’s\\nuse, porch cushions, kitchen aprons, beach bags, table runners for the porch,\\nbabies’ bibs, laundry bags, as coverings for kitchen articles (the scouring\\npowder can, match box, etc.), racks for pot holders, waste basket, etc.\\nW ool, yarn—The craze for knitted things of all kinds presents an opportunity\\nto sell knitted garments for babies and adults. Knitted suits and dresses sold\\nthrough the department stores start at around $50. The vogue for colonial\\nfurniture in the last few years has brought a demand for hooked rugs which\\nare in keeping with colonial interiors. These rugs are also suitable for summer\\ncottages. One young woman who made several rugs for herself, not only\\nachieved considerable skill in making the rugs, but speed as well, and could\\nmake the small type of bedroom rug in her spare time in a few days. Through\\nher friends, the local gift shop, and an advertisement in the neighborhood\\npaper, she secured orders which netted her enough profit to pay half her\\nhousehold expenses. Her rugs sold because they were well made and were of\\nunusual designs. Modern designs can be hooked as well as the colonial type.\\nKnitted garments for babies, needle-point chair seats or footstool covers, all\\nsuggest ways of making money. Skill in this type of work always comes with\\npractice.\\nt eXtIles—Aprons and house dresses offer a fertile field for a woman’s cleverhands. Many a small business has been built up by someone who started\\nmaking aprons and selling them to her neighbors. Nelly Donnelly is today\\none of the most successful makers of women’s dresses and aprons in the\\nUnited States. She started this business in a little workroom in the attic of her\\nKansas City home. Most manufacturers thought then that women would not\\npay more than 69 or 79 cents for wash frocks to wear about the house. Nelly\\nDonnelly knew better and proved it by building a success with $1.00 wash\\ndresses. Many women have found that men like their shirts made to order and\\nwill pay a little more for a well-tailored garment. Handmade handkerchiefs\\nfor men and women, curtains and draperies, slip-covers for furniture, hand-\\nquilted comfortables and “throws,” smocks, shoe and dress bags, infants’ and\\nchildren’s garments, fancy costumes for parties and school plays, collar and\\ncuff sets, are other suggestions. The secret of success in this field is not to try\\nto compete with cheap merchandise now on the market. People are willing to\\npay a price for handmade things. Make your dresses, aprons, shirts, and other\\nthings of excellent material and good workmanship and put a good price on\\nthem.\\nM etal—There is a vogue just now for articles made of tin. Almost any type\\nof tin can be used to make such things as candlesticks, book ends, vases,\\nboxes, sconces, and toys for children. All that is needed in the way of\\nequipment is a work bench, a pair of leather gloves, a pair of heavy shears, a\\nblock of wood, a wooden mallet, a pair of dividers, a half round file, a vise,\\nand a soldering outfit. The finished product should be given two coats of\\npaint. In addition to making useful and ornamental objects of this metal one\\nmay use other metals such as embossed copper, brass, and pewter. These\\nrequire a little more skill in handling. Tin may also be embossed. Hand-\\nwrought iron equipment for fireplaces, home-markers (swinging sign at the\\ngate), foot-scrapers, lanterns for colonial doorways, and other such items are\\nin demand today, due, no doubt, to the revival of interest in the colonial mode\\nof decoration. Lighting fixtures of wood and copper or wrought iron and\\nwood are simple to make. Not long ago a woman inventor in Chicago grossed\\n$6,000 a month, making hair curlers out of lip stick containers. Sheet metal is\\nanother material which can be handled dexterously by the amateur craftsman.\\nThis material makes up into good-looking stands, baskets, racks, shelves, fire\\nscreens, bird cages, lawn ornaments, stools, tables, lamp bases, book ends,cigarette boxes, ash trays, toys, novelties, and innumerable other things. Until\\nrecently, this work meant tedious hours with soldering irons and other hand\\ntools. Now, however, with the new sheet metal working outfit on the market,\\nthe home craftsman can use the same methods as the modern factory does.\\nWith this equipment, a simple piece like a metal waste basket can be\\ncompleted in less than half an hour and the total cost, including the paint, is\\nless than twenty cents. The makers of the metal working equipment furnish\\nbooks of designs and patterns as well as the necessary materials.\\no ther MaterIals—Parchment lamp shades (particularly shades for wall lights)\\nare always in good taste. The parchment may be purchased in the stores and\\nmany department stores have trained women on their staffs who will help you\\nwith designs. Handmade baskets, pottery, beadwork, batik work and hand-\\nloomed fabrics are not difficult to learn to make and bring good prices. Raffia\\nmakes beautiful table mats and coverings for wine bottles. Shells make droll\\nlittle figures. Sheet celluloid makes costume jewelry, buttons, silhouettes, etc.\\nA scroll or jig saw is necessary for this work. Old inner tubes can be used to\\nmake marionettes—the rubber helps to make the dancing figures more\\nrealistic. Leather covered boxes, desk pads, letter cases, telephone book\\ncovers, book carriers, and many other articles made of leather sell well in the\\nstores today, especially at Christmas. Tooled leather work is not hard to learn\\n—a surprisingly small number of tools are needed to carry on the entire work.\\nSome of the plastics on the market today can be used to make ornamental and\\nuseful items that are money makers.

Think\\nof what they were up against. They had come to a new country, about which\\nthey knew very little, seeking religious freedom and an opportunity to\\nprosper. The country to which they came had no currency. There was no\\ngovernment to guarantee their livelihood. There was no police force toprotect their property. All they had was a lot of courage and as much ground\\nas they required to raise the things they needed. And Mother Earth did not\\ndisappoint them. What they planted grew. The live stock which they brought\\nfrom England multiplied. And by barter and trade, they laid the foundation of\\nthe New England Confederation—that group of states north of New\\nAmsterdam which has since become known as New England.\\nAny American who has a patch of ground, no matter if it be only the back\\nyard of a city lot, is infinitely better off than his Pilgrim forbears. At least he\\nhas close at hand a market for what he raises. He has the benefit of a medium\\nof exchange, so that he can sell the things he raises for money. He enjoys the\\nsecurity and protection of the armed forces of the state in which he lives. He\\ndoes not have to get out of bed in the middle of the night to fight off\\nmarauding Indians. And if he can devise a way of raising things that are in\\ndemand, he can expand his activities until he has built up a large and\\nprofitable business. No other country of the world, unless possibly it might be\\nCanada, offers such opportunities to the man who is not afraid of work and\\nwho has a desire to raise things to sell.\\nUnder our present complex system of living, however, it is important that\\ncareful consideration be given to what you raise. It is not just a matter of\\nplanting corn and potatoes, as it was in the days of the Pilgrim Fathers. Corn\\nand potatoes may be a drug on the market in the community in which you\\nlive, so it might be much smarter for you to raise something else. What that\\nsomething else ought to be depends upon a lot of things. It depends upon\\nwhat you are best qualified to raise; it depends upon what you would enjoy\\nraising; it depends upon the needs of the people to whom you must sell the\\nthings you raise, and upon what can most profitably be raised in the particular\\nlocality in which you operate. A widow in Victoria, British Columbia, made\\nthousands of dollars raising tuberous begonia bulbs. She started raising the\\nbulbs as a hobby in the back yard of her Victoria home. Today, she has a big\\nbusiness and the begonias are shipped all over the world. Much of her\\nsuccess was due to the mild climatic conditions of that part of Vancouver\\nIsland. It does not follow that you would be as successful in a community less\\nfavored by nature.In the same way there is a man in Florida who raises alligators for leather. He\\nused to hunt them in the Everglades, but found he could make more money\\nraising them. By raising them himself he was able to get skins of just the\\nright age and size, which is quite important. This man has made a great deal\\nof money raising gators. But in order to conduct such a business successfully\\nyou have to seek a locality which is favorable for the growing of alligators.\\nAn alligator farm would not go in Maine, but a mink farm might do\\namazingly well. So one of the first things to consider when you set out to\\nraise something to sell is to fit your product to the climate. Then, too, give\\nconsideration to style changes. A chap in California spent a lot of money to\\nstart an ostrich farm. He made a great success of ostrich farming so far as\\nraising the birds was concerned. But soon after he got things going well,\\nostrich plumes went out of style and he went broke.\\nPeople who have not had much experience in raising things are inclined to\\nlook with favor upon various land development schemes. As a rule these are\\nnot practical. Some years ago a company was formed to plant and develop\\n7,000 acres of orange trees on Lake Pontchartrain, within the limits of the\\ncity of New Orleans. The land was cleared, drained, and planted in five-acre\\ngroves. They were sold to people of moderate means in the North. The\\ndevelopment company undertook to plant the trees, and cultivate the groves\\nuntil the trees reached bearing age, then they were to be taken over by the\\ngrove owner and personally operated. In theory the plan had many\\nattractions. But it turned out to be a failure because the scale of operation was\\ntoo big. When a freeze comes in a climate like New Orleans, an orange\\ngrower living on his land can get on the job and take precautions against the\\nfrost, either with oil heaters or smudge pots. It is an individual responsibility.\\nThere are today a number of small orange groves in lower Louisiana which\\nproduce remarkably fine oranges, but almost without exception the owners\\nlive on the groves and are in a position to go into action quickly upon the first\\nfrost warnings. While there have been instances where these development\\nschemes have worked out successfully, as a rule it is much better to put your\\nmoney in an improved place of your own rather than in a big scale\\ndevelopment.\\nThe price of farm land is still low, but it is steadily increasing in value. Manybusiness men are buying foreclosed farms as a hedge against inflation. If you\\nare looking for a small place of your own on which to raise the things you\\nintend to sell, you may find just what you are seeking from one of the\\ninsurance companies or land banks. Other things being equal, the man who is\\ngoing to raise things to sell, and whose capital is limited, should get as close\\nas possible to his market.\\nHe Cultivates Violas for the Market\\nI\\nN TREE-STUDDED Lafayette Square, a spacious park a little over a mile\\nfrom San Francisco’s business center, F. W. Davis’ hobby of viola growing\\nhas become a profitable business, a business which has unsuspected money-\\nmaking opportunities for all those who love flowers. The viola looks like a\\npansy except that instead of the pansy face thin dark rays spread out from a\\nyellow center. A hundred years ago the Swiss viola found in the Alps was\\nblended with the pansy bringing forth a blossom resembling both the violet\\nand the pansy.\\nMr. Davis, a graduate of the Royal Horticultural Society of England, has\\nbeen interested in flowers for sixty years—all his life. He has had charge of\\nnurseries and chose viola raising as his hobby because of the opportunity it\\ngave him to experiment and bring forth new creations in size, shape and\\ncolor. For twenty-five years, while in charge of the Balboa Nurseries in San\\nFrancisco, he put all his spare time into the development and evolution of the\\nviola. He finally had one that he thought worth while and when a sufficient\\nsupply was ready he took them to a leading florist.\\nThe viola was an immediate sensation. So instead of a hobbyist Mr. Davis\\nbecame a commercial grower with a demand constantly exceeding the\\nsupply. He soon needed more ground and was fortunate in leasing the historic\\nplace up in the heights of Lafayette Square. While the park is owned by the\\ncity, the mansion and its grounds are still under private ownership.\\nThere are twenty-five plots four and one-half feet wide and from thirty toeighty feet long, tier upon tier, a solid acre of violas blending myriads of\\ncolors. As the cut flowers are ideal for decorative purposes the entire output\\nis marketed to San Francisco florists. Some of the plants are sold but Mr.\\nDavis makes no effort to sell them. At first people begged for a plant for their\\ngarden and cheerfully paid $5.00 for one. Prices now range from 50 cents up.\\nSixty varieties are under cultivation but the grower works continually on\\nthem and each year a new one is added. Getting new varieties is not exactly\\nsimple. It sometimes takes a thousand seedlings to produce one worth\\ncultivating. To bring out a red one is Mr. Davis’ ambition.\\nAs a new variety appears a name suggests itself. A pure white with gold\\ncenter, for instance, is called Shasta after the Shasta daisy, the Rainbow is\\nradiantly colored, and one brownish purple is named Othello. Another purple\\nsuggests “When Irish Eyes Are Smiling,” and is naturally Colleen. Then\\nthere’s Cocktail; its browns and yellows indicate the reason.\\nThere was no backsliding in the viola business during the depression. Mr.\\nDavis went right on selling all he and his daughter—his only assistant—could\\nraise. Like anyone who has found his right work, he’s happy in it. A wiry,\\nsparse, gray-haired man with a skin as bronzed as his khaki breeches, he\\nconducts you through the grounds with quiet contentment. If you ask him\\nwhether he is kept busy, he answers: “Oh yes, I generally work ten hours a\\nday and sometimes fifteen or twenty.”\\nA Map Salesman Learns How to Raise and Sell Broilers\\nT\\nHOUSANDS of people have started poultry farms. But not everyone has\\nbeen successful. One who did succeed was Howard Whitely, a salesman for a\\nmap publishing company. During the years he had been a special\\nrepresentative for the publisher, he had made a good salary and had saved his\\nmoney. The doctor told him he had to give up his job and get outdoors in the\\nsunshine as much as possible. So he decided to buy a 15-acre farm near\\nIndianapolis. The former owner had tried to make a living by growingproduce, but Whitely decided to raise chickens.\\nNot knowing a great deal about raising chickens, he sent to the U. S.\\nDepartment of Agriculture for bulletins and studied them carefully. Then he\\nvisited a farmer in the neighborhood who had been raising poultry with\\nindifferent success. Here he learned what not to do if he wanted to make\\nmoney. Inquiry revealed that the farmer had little or no idea how to feed his\\nchickens and practically no ideas on marketing them. His poultry house was\\nfilthy, and it was obvious that the chickens had little or no attention from one\\nday to another. The farmer thought government bulletins and poultry\\nmagazines were a lot of nonsense. “As if,” he growled, “you can learn to\\nraise chickens from a book or a magazine.”\\nHowever, Howard Whitely had his own ideas on this subject which he\\ndiscreetly kept to himself. On his little farm there was a poultry house which\\nhe thoroughly cleaned and fumigated. He built a poultry run and then\\npurchased a second-hand incubator and a brooder from a dealer in town.\\nFrom another dealer he bought ten dozen eggs and then he started his poultry\\nbusiness. Some of the eggs, of course, did not hatch. Of those that did, he\\nkept about half for breeding, and the rest were raised for the market. In\\nraising the chickens, he followed the government bulletins religiously. He\\nfound that cleanliness was the most important thing in keeping the chickens\\nfree from disease. By preventing all possible contamination, he not only\\nsaved himself a load of trouble but considerable expense. Naturally, he made\\na few mistakes, but none of them serious. He found, too, that he liked raising\\npoultry.\\nIn the meantime, Whitely had been thinking about his marketing problem.\\nHaving been a salesman he realized it was one thing to raise a good product,\\nbut unless you got busy and sold it, there would be little profit to bank. By\\nthe time he had his poultry ready for market, he had secured orders from a\\nnumber of old customers in Indianapolis as well as from two hotels and three\\nrestaurants. When his customers saw the plump, milk-fed broilers he had\\nraised, they were sold to the hilt and he had no difficulty in getting reorders.\\nHe and his wife made a great effort to pack the birds attractively. Each capon\\nwas wrapped separately in white, moisture-proof wrapping paper, andpackaged four to a box. His prices were slightly above the store price, but not\\na kick was received. He was supplying the market with what he knew the\\nmarket wanted—a superior product. And the market was willing to pay for it.\\nThe hotels and restaurants gave him regular orders for poultry which he\\ndelivered every two or three days. His customers telephoned him when they\\nwanted a broiler and often drove out for it. He kept a card record of all his\\norders and when he failed to hear from a customer in a reasonable period of\\ntime, he followed him up by phone. Several friends of his oldtime customers\\ntelephoned him orders and he also added a fancy food shop to his list. This\\nshop, which catered to Indianapolis’ “400,” took only the very best of his\\nbroilers—and at very nice prices, too.\\nAnother good order he got was from the country club which was situated\\nabout half way between his farm and Indianapolis. He had heard that the club\\nwas planning a gala affair one week-end so he interviewed the club manager,\\nsold him a nice order of capons, and made a regular customer of him.\\nHoward Whitely made no attempt to market eggs as he realized that he could\\nnot develop a good egg-breed as well as meat-breed type and do justice to\\nboth. Whenever he had a surplus of eggs, he endeavored to sell them along\\nwith his poultry, but he never made any effort to secure a market for them.\\nMrs. Fox’s Mink Ranch\\nG\\nERTRUDE FOX , the wife of a busy doctor, tried to settle down to a\\npeaceful, quiet life among the Westchester hills. But like so many energetic,\\nenthusiastic people, an inactive life was impossible for her. She began\\nlooking around for a hobby and having previously raised domestic animals,\\ndecided that raising fur-bearing animals might be interesting. Her first idea\\nwas to develop a fox farm, but it had features that did not appeal to her.\\nSomebody suggested mink ranching and she decided to give it a “whirl.”\\nKnowing nothing about raising minks, she spent a whole year studying thesubject, reading every available book published and every government\\npamphlet on it. She also visited the few mink ranches scattered throughout\\nthe East and the Middle West. Most of these ranches, she found, were\\nstocked with Mississippi minks, whereas, the finest type of mink comes from\\nthe north shore of Labrador. The pelts of these animals are as dark and glossy\\nas sable. A coat made of an inferior grade of mink may bring only from $500\\nto $800, whereas, a coat made of Labrador skins brings from $6,000 to\\n$12,000. She reasoned that she might as well raise the best as long as she was\\ngoing to risk her time and money into the venture.\\nShe purchased her breeding stock, consisting of 11 males and 19 females,\\nfrom a rancher in northeastern Quebec. These animals were pure Labradors\\njust one generation removed from the wild. She set up her pens on the South\\nSalem estate and began experimenting, becoming so far as is known the first\\nwoman in this particular work. This was in 1929. In 1930 she was asked to\\nexhibit her pets at the Woman’s Exposition of Arts and Industries, and it was\\nthis event which marked the turning point in her career. Not one visitor in ten\\nat this exposition had ever heard of a mink ranch and interest ran high.\\nFrom that time on, she was kept busy supplying breeding stock to people who\\nwanted to start their own mink farms. As a matter of fact, while she started\\nmink raising to sell the pelts, she has never been able to pelt any of her\\nanimals. They have all been sold as breeding stock to amateur mink ranchers.\\nFrom raising minks she has drifted naturally into teaching others how to raise\\nthem. The beginners are instructed in methods of constructing pens and\\nrunways and in proper ways of handling and feeding the animals. Her interest\\nin her customers, or students, as she terms them, extends a year after they\\nhave purchased their herds. During this time they may write to her about their\\nproblems and she will advise them on points of feeding and handling.\\nAs keeping the minks free from vermin is one difficulty in raising them, Mrs.\\nFox emphasizes the importance of building pens so that they are raised from\\nthe ground. With the exception of death from pneumonia, there are almost no\\nfatalities from disease and if their bedding is always dry minks are not likely\\nto have even this disease. The minks are fed a varied diet of beef, horse meat,ground bone, eggs, milk, cereals, tomatoes, cod liver oil, and fish. Each\\nanimal must be segregated from his fellows as the mink is a vicious little\\nbeast and will attack any other mink that comes near him. Fighting must be\\nprevented at all costs, as in addition to possible deaths which may occur, the\\npelts may be severely damaged. The mink mates once a year, in the spring,\\nand the litter consists of about five or six young. The young are born about\\nfifty days after mating and are hidden by the mother in her nest until they are\\nabout four weeks old. When an excessive litter occurs, the young are raised\\nby another mother mink or by a cat.\\nBesides managing two ranches of her own, providing breeding stock for\\namateur ranchers and publishing a monthly bulletin on fur trade conditions,\\nMrs. Fox owns and edits The Black Fox Magazine and has published a very\\npractical book by the title of Raising Minks in Captivity.\\nGoat Dairying—a Coming Business\\nR\\nOBERT FEARN , Norbeck, Maryland, is a goat dairyman, and a very\\nsuccessful one. He seldom raises any kids, as he finds it more economical to\\nbuy new milking stock each fall and sell his culls in the spring. When he\\nbegan business he had 125 does for which he paid $10 a head. But he learned\\nit paid to buy better stock. Now he has about 30 for which he paid from $50\\nto $75 each. From these 30 does he gets four times as much milk as from the\\n125 inferior ones. In December and January, he gets about 70 pints daily\\nfrom 25 does; in summer, 200 pints. The six- or eight-quart does, so eagerly\\nsought by the beginner in goat keeping, are of little interest to Mr. Fearn. He\\nconsiders a doe, even when she is giving but three pints a day, a profitable\\none. Animals which give around six to eight quarts a day are very rare and\\nare hardly ever for sale. Generally speaking, a production of two quarts a day\\nis fair, three quarts good, and anything over that, excellent.\\nThe does in Mr. Fearn’s dairy are not permitted to run about as they please.\\nThey must lie down, chew their cuds and make milk. At milking time they go\\nin groups of ten to the milking room, stand in stanchions and are fed. Greatcare is taken to see that the milk is pure. It takes about thirty minutes to\\nprepare them for milking and to milk them. By that time they have eaten their\\nfeed. By milking three times a day, he finds that he gets more milk. “Soy\\nbean hay,” states Mr. Fearn, “produces the best milk. Lespedeza is, without\\ndoubt, the coming roughage. The goats are very keen about it when they can\\nget it.”\\nFeeding rations vary considerably and each breeder or dairyman must\\nexperiment until he finds the proper combination of feeds for his stock.\\nInformation on this subject can be secured from the U. S. Department of\\nAgriculture, Washington, D. C.; from The Goat World, Vincennes, Indiana;\\nthe Dairy Goat Journal, Fairbury, Nebraska, and the American Goat Society,\\nInc., Herkimer, New York.\\nThe goat selected by most breeders for stock today is a pure-bred, imported\\ntype. The American or “scrub” goat does not give good milk production and\\nits kids command very low prices. It is, undoubtedly, to the best interest of\\nthe goat owner to purchase pure-bred animals only and to see that all the kids\\nare registered. The types usually purchased by breeders and dairymen are the\\nToggenburg, Saanen, Nubian, French Alpine, Rock Alpine, and the\\nMurciana. The Toggenburg is the biggest milk producer and the Nubian is\\nnoted for the richness of its milk, the butter fat content being much higher\\nthan in any of the other breeds. The price of pure-breds will run not less than\\n$35 for mature stock or $15 for kids. Certain stock for breeding may run\\nsomewhat higher than these prices and, naturally, outstanding breeding stock\\nwill bring very fancy prices just as any other kind of fancy live stock does.\\nGoat milk sells for 25 cents to 50 cents a quart. As it is the nearest animal\\nmilk to human milk, it is an excellent food for babies. However, being much\\nricher than cow’s milk, it must be diluted by more than 50 per cent before a\\nbaby can assimilate it. Goat milk is alkaline instead of acid (cow’s milk is\\nacid), so it is an excellent food for invalids, old people, and those suffering\\nfrom stomach disturbances. Goat milk also contains one important mineral\\nwhich cow’s milk lacks—iron. The taste of goat’s milk is very palatable if\\nthe animal has been fed correctly. There will be absolutely no disagreeable\\nodor or taste if the doe’s stall is kept clean, the milk is handled in a sanitarymanner, and the bucks are kept in another stable altogether. As the goat is\\npractically free from tuberculosis, its milk does not carry that dread disease\\ngerm. But to make certain that the goats are not likely to contact tuberculosis,\\nthey should be kept separate from cows.\\nMr. Fearn’s merchandising methods are particularly interesting. Instead of\\nselling to hospitals and doctors, he has placed small refrigerators in drug\\nstores in Washington and Baltimore. They are attractively labeled and have\\nglass doors that give a view of the pint-size paper bottles of goat milk. Each\\npint bottle sells for 25 cents and they have a ready sale.\\nThe dairyman may also find a market for goats’ milk in the canneries which\\nare now putting up a brand of evaporated, unsweetened goats’ milk. This\\nretails for 20 cents a can of 11 ounces, which is equivalent to about 30 cents a\\nquart for the original milk.\\nA doe averaging two quarts a day for 10 months produces 600 quarts. At 25\\ncents a quart, this returns an income of $150. Feed for the doe for 12 months\\nat 10 cents a day would be $36. The profit less the labor cost would be $114.\\nA three-quart doe would give about 900 quarts at 25 cents or $225. The feed\\nwould probably cost a little more, say 12 ½ cents daily or $45. This would\\nmake a profit less the labor cost of $180. This little comparison between the\\ntwo- and three-quart milker easily shows how much more profitable the\\nbetter milker can be. It is conservatively said that a good doe will pay her\\npurchase price back in milk each year and an extra dividend in kids.\\nCheese As a Source of Income\\nA great many goat owners have failed to recognize the opportunity existing\\nto make additional money producing and selling goat cheese. Some of the\\nfinest imported cheeses are made from goat milk. Tons of these cheeses are\\ncoming into this country every year and finding a ready market. There is a\\ngood market for domestic cheeses also, but the public must be taught the\\nvalue of good domestic goat cheeses. Among the cheeses made from goat\\nmilk which are finding favor today are cottage, cream, Neufchatel, cheddar,\\nRoquefort, Swiss, Parmesan, and primost or brown whey cheese. Directionsfor making these cheeses can be secured from your state agricultural\\nexperiment station, the U. S. Department of Agriculture, or from the Dairy\\nGoat Journal, Fairbury, Nebraska.\\nIt is well for the amateur to begin with soft cheeses such as cottage, cream\\nand Neufchatel, as these are easy to learn to make. The first thing to know\\nabout making cheese is that your does must test pretty high in butter fat or\\nyou cannot make a quality cheese. Good cheese simply cannot be made with\\npoor quality milk.\\nWhere is the market for goat cheese? If you already have a market for milk,\\neveryone of your customers is a prospect for cheese. Take samples to your\\nregular customers when you deliver your milk. Also place samples in the\\nstores in your locality.\\nAdvertise locally and don’t forget to have some signs on the roads\\napproaching your dairy as well as a large sign on the dairy itself. Passing\\nmotorists are frequently good prospects. Your neighbors, your friends, and\\nthe friends of your friends are all prospects for your products. Tell them\\nabout the value of goat milk and cheese. If you make good cheese, “tell the\\nworld about it”—word-of-mouth advertising moves a great deal of\\nmerchandise.\\nA Different Kind of Poultry Farm\\nA\\nCHICKEN farm, organized along factory lines, has been a great success in\\nthe East. This poultry farm near Cockeysville, Maryland, covers only one\\nacre of ground. The 61,000 chickens handled by this farm would require 610\\nacres if they were being raised and fed in the usual manner. On this farm,\\nhowever, the chickens never touch the ground—never go outdoors. They live\\nin tiers of wire cages, in large, air-conditioned, disinfected, thermostatically\\nheated and cooled, photoelectrically-lighted rooms. There are no nests for the\\n2,500 laying hens, as the cages are so arranged that eggs, when laid, roll\\ndown into a little rack outside. Here the eggs are picked up by attendants onhourly collection rounds. Under these conditions, the daily production of\\nlaying hens is 58 per cent as against the usual 50 per cent figure.\\nThe chickens’ food is within easy reach of each cage, being supplied on a\\nconveyor belt which runs on each tier. A constant drip of water is provided\\nfrom a metal nipple at the top of the cages. A second conveyor belt, running\\nunder the cages, catches the waste matter which is carried to a bin and there\\nremoved periodically to be used in making a highgrade fertilizer.\\nAs any infection would be disastrous to the entire flock of 61,000 chickens,\\nthe utmost cleanliness prevails. Each room is disinfected once a day and, at\\nshort intervals, all cages are subjected to live steam. The twentyone\\nemployees wear spotless uniforms—the women being dressed in white and\\nthe men in striped linen trousers and coats.\\nThis factory-operated farm has created such interest that not only have\\nfarmers in adjacent communities made trips to the farm, but those from\\ndistant lands, such as Egypt and Africa. In fact, so numerous are the visitors\\nduring the week-ends, that the cages have been separated from the onlookers\\nby walls of glass in order to minimize the danger of infection.\\nSelling “Fighting” Fish by Mail\\nW\\nHEN Bill Klaiber, of San Francisco, took up the hobby of breeding Siamese\\nfighting fish and other tropical varieties, he little realized he was starting\\nwhat has since turned out to be a “national” fish business.\\nBill’s regular job is a glass worker for a paint manufacturer. He began raising\\ntropical fish three years ago, having bought some fish from a friend who was\\ngoing out of business. As usual, Bill delved deeply into his subject, reading\\neverything he could find; even buying expensive books unobtainable in the\\nlibrary. He applied what he read and added constantly to his stock. Fanciers\\nheard of his fine collection and came to buy. Bill Klaiber was amazed at the\\nmarketing possibilities and the eagerness of people to secure a coveted\\nspecimen. So he became a dealer as well as a fancier before many monthspassed.\\nHe had made contact with seamen to secure rare fish for him when they went\\ninland for fresh water in the tropics. Today he maintains tanks on a number of\\nboats that reach the tropics, paying seamen to look after his interests.\\nWhen an opportunity came three months ago to buy a small hatchery\\ncomplete, Bill moved his outfit to a larger store which he remodeled and\\ncalled “Kay’s Aquarium.” His wife spends part of each day there and he\\nkeeps open evenings and Sundays.\\nThere’s a tropical atmosphere about Kay’s Aquarium. Innumerable tiny fish,\\nstreaks of iridescence and brilliant color, dart about in small tanks. Aquatic\\nplants furnish both oxygen and decoration.\\nCaring for the fish is easy. The real work is in breeding, but therein lies its\\nfascination. It means time and patience and often disappointment, but Bill\\nKlaiber never tires of hybridizing and trying for perfect specimens. Some\\nspecies, such as the Scalare, are particularly difficult to handle. “These\\nfellows,” he explains, “won’t marry unless the bride pleases them and it takes\\nfinesse and many females to induce them to become breeders.” The fact is\\nthat Bill is one of the two or three fanciers in town who have succeeded in\\nmaking benedicts out of the Scalare. Another rare specimen deposits its\\norange colored eggs in an even row on a long reed, and the male and female\\n“spell” one another guarding the eggs and foraging for food.\\nThe Betta or Siamese fighting fish, in which he specializes, are kept singly in\\nmayonnaise jars because if placed together they would fight each other to the\\ndeath. In Siam, Bettas are used for gambling, and fortunes have been won or\\nlost on the outcome of staged battles. The little savage is correspondingly\\ntender in courtship, however, guarding the fertilized spawn against would-be\\ndevourers, including its erstwhile mate.\\nVolumes might be written about the tiny tank dwellers. Bill’s initial stock of\\nthirty that cost him two dollars has increased to several hundreds. He receives\\norders from Texas, the Middle West—even Canada, and his weekly profit\\nsometimes exceeds his salary. How does he get his trade? News, of course,travels fast among fanciers and much of his new business comes from friends\\nof old customers.\\nOne reason for his success is his practice of selling only healthy stock. He\\nbelieves that while “sluffing off” sickly fish is easy, it is a foolish thing to do.\\nAnother reason for his success is because he sets up the aquarium, if desired,\\nkeeps in touch with customers, and gives the buyer help whenever he can.\\nA map in his outer room illustrates his thoroughness. Patiently he worked out\\na list of tropical fish and their habitats. On a map of the world he printed the\\nnames of various fish in the section where they are to be found. The map,\\nbesides being informative, is an aid in selecting stock.\\nBreeding Dogs for Fun and Profit\\nD\\nO YOU like dogs? Do dogs like you? Then why not turn that liking into\\ndollars? Why not combine business with pleasure and raise dogs? Perhaps no\\nbusiness offers better opportunities for making money in your spare time or\\nto develop a national reputation in your field. For instance, Mrs. Harold\\nCluxton, of Chicago, regarded as one of the most successful breeders of\\nRussian wolfhounds in America, started her kennels as a hobby.\\nIt was not until Mrs. Cluxton was given a very fine pair of Russian\\nwolfhounds by a friend living in Canada that she decided to establish her own\\nkennels. She became intensely interested in the breed and studied everything\\nshe could find on the subject. She subscribed to all the dog magazines\\npublished both here and in England and even went so far as to study the\\nRussian language, so that she could read what had been published in that\\ncountry on wolfhounds. She has carried off nearly all the prizes for\\nwolfhounds in most of the shows, and has obtained as high as $5,000 for a\\nsingle dog.\\nOne of the nice things about breeding and raising dogs is that you can start\\nwith as little as $100 capital. True, you cannot get a “blue ribbon” dog forany such sum, but with a little shopping around and good judgment you can\\nget a likely bitch for that amount in a number of popular breeds. First of all\\ndecide upon the breed on which you intend to specialize and get a registered\\nbitch of the best blood lines possible. The bitch should be healthy and should\\nnot vary in type from the breed she represents. In other words, if the breed is\\nsupposed to be heavy of bone, select breeding stock with this characteristic.\\nCheck up on the breed carefully and find out the main points upon which the\\nanimals are judged, then try to get as many good points in your breeding\\nstock as you possibly can. If possible, purchase stock from a line in which\\nthere have been blue ribbon winners as this gives you a good selling point to\\ntalk about to prospective purchasers.\\nAs in every business, there are hazards in dog raising. Worms and distemper\\ntake the greatest toll of puppies, but both can be controlled if the breeder is\\ncareful. At the beginning it is wise to invest money in the services of a good\\nveterinary to handle the first few litters, to worm the puppies and take care of\\nany other problems with which you are not familiar. This will, of course, cost\\nyou extra money and must be figured in your overhead. In addition, you will\\nneed the services of a veterinary to guard your kennel against distemper.\\nEvery breeder who wishes to protect himself, as well as his customers,\\nagainst losses from distemper, has his puppies inoculated against this dread\\ndisease at the proper time. If you take chances with this disease, you are sure\\nto regret it as the expense of bringing even one puppy through it is\\nconsiderable. So many times the veterinary cannot save the dog and then the\\nexpensive treatments, plus the loss of the dog, will eat up your profits.\\nIf you like dogs, you probably have attended the dog shows and know\\nsomething about the various breeds. Of course, the most popular dog appears\\nat the dog shows in great numbers. One year it will be the German shepherds\\n(commonly called police dogs), another year, wire-haired terriers, another\\nyear Airedales or Scotties. Then there are certain breeds that never seem to go\\nout of style. Over a period of time these have been the Boston bull terrier, the\\nPekingese, and the cocker spaniel. Certain types of hunting dogs are always\\npopular. The setter (both English and Irish) is favored by those who never\\nshoot game as well as by the sportsman. The German shepherd has been\\nanother unusually popular dog, but as he is not quite suited to city life hispopularity is beginning to wane.\\nFor the city type of home and especially for those who live in apartment\\nbuildings, the following dogs are the most suitable, due to their size and their\\nadaptability to city life:\\nBoston bull terriers, French bulldogs, dachshunds, wirehaired fox terriers,\\nsmooth fox terriers, cocker spaniels, Scottish terriers, Irish terriers, the\\nPekingese, the Pomeranian, the sealyham, miniature schnauzer, Japanese\\nspaniel, and the Yorkshire terrier.\\nFor the suburban home, the dogs just listed and the following are the most\\nsuitable breeds:\\nEnglish and Irish setters, Irish water spaniels, the springer spaniel, Airedale-\\nterriers, collies, Dobermann Pinschers, German shepherds, Dalmatian\\nhounds, chowchows, German schnauzer (medium size), pointers, beagle\\nhounds, Gordon setters, bull terriers, and bulldogs.\\nFor the large estate or farm, the following dogs may be added to those listed\\nfor the suburban home:\\nRussian wolfhound, Irish wolfhound (the largest of all dogs), St. Bernard,\\nmastiff, Great Dane, Newfoundland, Labrador retriever, Shetland sheep dog.\\nIf you are in a section where there is considerable hunting each year, the\\nfollowing hunting breeds may sell well:\\nSpringer spaniels, Irish water spaniels, beagle hounds, rabbit hounds,\\ncoonhounds, deerhounds, foxhounds, Labrador retrievers, English and Irish\\nsetters, pointers, Llewellyn and Gordon setters.\\nRegardless of the fact that in your locality there may exist a market for the\\nlarger breed of dog such as the St. Bernard, mastiff, Great Dane, etc., the\\nbeginner may do well to cultivate another market in which he can sell the\\nsmaller breeds. The reasons for this are obvious. You need a large amount of\\nground to maintain kennels for the larger breeds, and the food bill for these\\nbreeds is an important item in your overhead as you will realize once you\\nhave seen a St. Bernard eat.\\nRaising dogs naturally entails a great deal of work—kennels must be kept\\nimmaculate to ward off disease, the dogs must be brushed and combed, their\\nfood must be carefully prepared and they must be fed at regular periods.When ill they must be segregated and carefully tended not only for\\nhumanitarian reasons but for financial reasons also. The dam must be cared\\nfor especially at whelping time and the puppies must be given a great deal of\\nattention. Then there is weaning which means more work. However, if you\\nreally like to handle dogs, all this work will be interesting and therefore not\\ndrudgery.\\nFor advertising you will need to have some cards printed for prospects who\\ncome to see the pups, the local paper should carry your advertising, and every\\nmerchant in your vicinity should know that you are a breeder of Scotties,\\nBostons, or whatever breed you intend handling. An advertisement in the\\nSunday morning edition of the largest circulation newspaper in your city, or\\nif you live in the suburbs or country, the nearest large city, will often bring\\nprospects. Be sure to include your telephone number.\\nMany small breeders raise dogs as a side line and manage a full-time job also.\\nIn this case, someone else in the family must have the routine care of the\\ndogs. One interesting example is that of a laundry driver in Chicago who\\nworked six days a week for one of the largest laundries in the city. He and his\\nwife lived in a little cottage on a three-acre place on the edge of town. Both\\nof them were unusually fond of dogs and hunting. Having purchased a fine\\nEnglish setter for their hunting trips they decided to put him at stud. The\\ncharge made for this was $25 and in addition they received two male puppies\\nfrom the litter, each of which sold for $35. The dog was bred again at the\\nsame charge and two pups again were sold for $35 and $40. With this money,\\nthey purchased a cocker spaniel of good blood lines and placed him at stud.\\nThe first two pups they received, a male and a female, sold for $35 and $30,\\nrespectively (the female usually brings a lower price than the male puppies).\\nLater a female cocker spaniel was purchased which came from a blue ribbon\\nline and the litters from this pair sold from $35 to $45 a puppy.\\nFresh eggs from his own chickens, rich milk from a near-by farmer, careful\\nfeeding and plenty of sunshine gave his puppies good bone and muscle and\\nshining coats. They practically sold themselves “on sight.” Naturally, his\\ncustomers were told about these puppies when they were available and many\\norders were received through their “word-of-mouth” advertising. A friendly\\narrangement with a “training school” for hunting dogs gave him some good\\nleads and at the same time provided the school with the names of those who\\nhad made recent purchases of puppies.Bee Keeping for Profit\\nG\\nEORGE JESSUP , Council Bluffs, Iowa, began raising bees as a side line.\\nBefore long, this side line returned enough profits to more than take care of\\nexpenses, and today his income from bee keeping exceeds a thousand dollars\\nannually. In fact, bees not only pay all his household expenses, but enable\\nhim to put a good round sum in the bank every year.\\n“Few occupations,” says Jessup, “offer the interest and relaxation bee\\nkeeping affords, and for the office worker it has the additional incentive of\\nbeing carried on out of doors. I started with one colony in a large hive, which\\nI was told would provide ample room for brooding and winter storage,\\neliminate swarming, and provide large combs for the queen bee thus making\\nher more efficient. My initial expenses for bees and equipment ran about\\ntwenty dollars, and my cost of producing honey that year was five dollars.\\nThe colony produced a hundred pounds of honey, all of which I sold locally\\nto retailers at an average price of sixty cents a bail, a measure which contains\\nfive pounds.\\n“The second year the colony was increased greatly by a winter brood, so I\\nsplit it, and made a second colony, which also came in with a hundred pounds\\nof honey. That, I found, was about the average yield for each bee colony.\\nMeanwhile, I was so pleased with the way the bee keeping was going, that I\\nincreased the number of colonies to ten, and sold some of the honey at\\nwholesale, getting an average of forty-five cents a bail for it. There is, of\\ncourse, more work connected with the ten colonies, but not a great deal more\\nas about all there is to do is gather the honey. Bees do not require much\\nattention. You can leave them alone for several days and they will feed\\nthemselves and work for you while you are away. Last year, I added fifteen\\nmore colonies, to bring the total number to twenty-five, and my profit\\nincreased proportionately.\\n“Most of the honey I produce goes to local grocers. Some of it I ship toDubuque and points not too distant. I sell to local grocers at sixty cents a bail\\nas a general rule, and get fifty-five to seventy cents from outside markets.\\nWhen I sell to the consumer, I get twenty cents a pound, and I did a lot of\\nconsumer business last year. It’s in that market most of the money is to be\\nmade. However, I haven’t been able to take the time to develop consumer\\ndemand properly, although I’ve been determined for a long time to go after it.\\n“Bee keeping is fascinating as well as profitable. You can keep bees in any\\nplace—the cellar, barn, garage, attic or even in a closet which has an outside\\nwindow, and be perfectly sure that as long as you have a good queen in\\ncharge, the colony will stay ‘put.’ If the colony is permitted to get too large,\\nhowever, there is a chance that a queen coming out of the winter brood will\\nlure a portion of them to swarm in a hollow tree somewhere. So it is good\\npolicy to watch them and separate them, giving the queens from your brood a\\nhouse of their own so they won’t lure other bees to swarm.\\n“I believe much of my success has been due to the use of the Caucasian bees\\nexclusively. These bees are gentler and permit you to work among them\\nfaster than you could with other types. They seem to be less inclined to\\ndevelop disease, and their crop of honey is fully as good as the Italian bee.\\nExperience has taught me the disadvantages of the big hive, however, and I\\nnow use standard ten frame equipment, with full depth hive bodies for supers.\\nI simplify the provisioning of the brood chamber by slipping in a frame of\\nhoney from another super, assuring ample winter stores. Combs with patches\\nof drone are easily removed by exchanging with combs from supers and\\nallowing the brood to emerge above. When the comb is filled with honey at\\nthe end of the season it is handled right along with the rest of the crop until\\nextracted. A mark across the top bar, made with a hive tool, makes its\\nidentification simple and disposal sure.”\\nA bee apiary may be started with a few dollars. A small colony will more\\nthan pay for itself in a short time, and furnish a hobby or a side line that is\\nimmensely fascinating. Housing equipment may be made by yourself, or may\\nbe purchased for as little as ten dollars. The equipment is designed as a\\npermanent colony home, and is built to withstand freezing temperatures.Bees may be secured at very reasonable prices. You may buy a twopound\\npackage of baby bees, with a young queen, for as little as two dollars. Two or\\nthree of such packages will start a very fine colony for you, and will soon be\\nproducing a hundred pounds of honey annually or better. It may be pointed\\nout that the existing demand for honey far exceeds visible supply, and that a\\ngood price may be obtained for your entire honey yield all the year round.\\nWholesale prices vary somewhat in different sections of the country, ranging\\nfrom thirty to fifty-five cents a bail. Retail prices range between forty-five\\ncents and eighty-five cents a bail. In most sections, however, neither\\nwholesale prices nor retail fluctuate much more than ten cents a bail.\\nThere’saBigDemandfor OrnamentalBirds\\n“\\nI\\nTURNED sixty acres, not suitable for farming, into pens for raising\\nornamental birds,” said John Keller, of Kenosha, Wisconsin. “This land has a\\npond at one end and a shallow creek runs through it, but the rocks and\\nmarshy spots make it bad pasture. It was the pond that made me think of\\ntrying my luck with swans. These sixty acres, being handy to the house,\\nwould be ideal for swan raising I figured, because I could easily watch the\\nbirds. I paid sixty-five dollars for a pair of white swans, fenced off pen space\\nfor them at the edge of the pond. I read a good deal about the swan’s habits\\nand found it is an affectionate bird which, once mated, will never leave its\\nmate. They lay in March, April and May, prefer to live by themselves, and\\nmust be kept away from animals. My first brood was seven young swans and\\nby the end of the summer, I had eighteen swans. The swan, being very hardy,\\nis not difficult to raise. It requires less care than a turkey or a chicken, and\\nbrings higher prices. My original investment was sixty-five dollars for the\\nfirst pair and thirty dollars for fencing. By Christmas, I had sold eight pair of\\nyoung swans, at seventy dollars a pair. I kept the others for breeding. In two\\nand a half years, I’ve raised and sold a hundred-and-fifty pair of swans at an\\naverage price of sixty dollars.“Shortly after I started the swans, I decided to experiment a little with\\npeacocks as I had plenty of room. The peacock, I soon discovered, needed a\\nhigh fence around the entire area used for raising him, since these birds have\\nthe habit of roosting on housetops, trees, and other high places, and refuse to\\nsleep in a coop. They are quite hardy birds, almost as easy to handle as swans\\nand are not bothered much by the cold. They are more prolific than the swan,\\nand because of the beauty of their plumage sell for big prices. I get up to\\nninety-five dollars for a pair of well-matched green peacocks, and last year\\nsold seventy-six pair at this price.\\nAbout the only thing I have to watch closely is that no dogs or other small\\nanimals get into the big pens. While the swan and peacock are large birds,\\nwell able to take care of themselves in any battle with a dog, the presence of a\\ndog or the threat of one visiting them is sufficient to keep the birds from\\nlaying. Frighten a peacock or swan and it seems to lose all desire to lay. The\\nswan is not subject to disease such as attack chickens, hence loss through\\ndisease and sickness is practically nil. The peacock and the swan mate for life\\nand care should be taken to discover how they mate up, and not to break up\\nmated birds. I figure the cost for raising a swan to be about three dollars, and\\nthree twenty-five for a peacock. This includes the cost of making the pens,\\nfeeding, incidental expenses, except labor. The work of looking after the\\nbirds, which is done by my wife and myself, takes only an hour or two each\\nday.”\\nThe raising of ornamental birds takes more space than would be required for\\nother fowl, inasmuch as these birds like to strut and preen themselves a good\\ndeal. There are many farms having marginal land that might profitably be\\ndevoted to raising these birds. A ready market is always at hand, as the\\ndemand for peacocks and swans by public parks, zoos, private estates,\\nplaygrounds, public and private institutions, and universities is greater than\\nthe existing supply.\\nOther ornamental birds may be raised along with swans and peacocks with\\nlittle added cost. For example, the Chinese Mandarin duck, wood duck and\\nRed Billed Tree duck will get along well with the swans, while Golden and\\nSilver pheasants and Pearl Guinea fowl will thrive with the peacocks.A Smart Way to Market Broilers\\nW\\nHEN Mrs. Alice Moffet, who lives on the outskirts of Blue Island, Illinois,\\ndecided it was up to her to help balance the family budget, she turned to\\nraising broilers to make money. After several months of experimenting with\\nmarketing ideas, she hit upon a method that enabled her to earn more than a\\nthousand dollars from her venture.\\n“Like many others who start a chicken ranch, I thought all one had to do was\\nfeed the little chicks, keep them warm, and when they were twelve weeks old,\\nsell them to the butcher. I knew nothing about marketing poultry. I soon\\nfound out, however, that to make a big profit from broilers, they should be\\ndressed and packaged attractively before marketing.\\n“I followed the accepted practice of buying one-day-old chicks from\\nresponsible hatcheries. Putting them in brooders, I carried them along until\\nthey were twelve weeks old. In developing the pullets for market, I made\\nmany mistakes which I have since corrected. I had permitted the chickens to\\nrun in a large pen which made their flesh tough. Now I no longer let them run\\nabout but keep them in a special ‘broiler plant’ and they bring better prices.\\nKeeping the chicks in the ‘broiler plant’ enables me to feed and care for 500\\nday-old chicks in a small space. At twelve weeks they are ready for market\\nand bring top prices.\\n“At first, I shipped the live pullets to the wholesale house, but I soon\\ndiscovered that the loss from shrinkage in shipping, regardless of distance, is\\nabout 10 per cent, which cuts heavily into their market value. Pullets lose\\nweight when shipped due to handling and irregular feeding. The first time I\\nchecked this loss against the price paid me by the commission companies, I\\ncouldn’t understand it. I was doing a big business but wasn’t making money.\\nSo I experimented with some marketing ideas. Instead of selling the pullets\\nalive, I dressed them and packaged them in attractive pasteboard boxes\\nlabeled, ‘Milk-Fed Broilers.’ I sold them to the butchers who get a few cents\\na pound more for dressed broilers attractively wrapped in waxed paper thanthey can get for live pullets.\\n“Experience convinces me that cross-bred pullets make the best broilers.\\nTheir hybrid vigor makes them gain faster than pure-bred chickens, and they\\ngenerally weigh 30 per cent more at twelve weeks than a purebred pullet. But\\nin growing pullets for broiler purposes, the most important thing is the feed.\\nOnly a good feed can develop a broiler to the limit of its inherent capacity. A\\nchick of the heavier breeds will gain up to thirty times its weight in a period\\nof a few weeks if given a carefully selected prepared feed.”\\nWhile Mrs. Moffet now has a chicken house forty feet long and eighteen feet\\nwide, she started in a very small way; investing only $60 altogether. The\\npresent house cost $190 and her investment in equipment amounted to $160.\\nThis total of $350 was part of her profits. She pays four cents for one-day old\\nchicks in 500 quantities. Five hundred chicks, when twelve weeks old, cost a\\ntotal of $120. “When dressed, packaged in pasteboard containers, and\\nwrapped in waxed paper, they bring Mrs. Moffet a profit of about $50. The\\ncost of packaging of the pullets runs almost four cents each. Chickens for\\nbroiler purposes are not difficult to raise. As many as 200 may be developed\\nin a comparatively small space, with a small broiler plant. A ready market is\\nfurnished in every fair-sized city, especially during the spring. Prices for\\nbroilers vary with the season. Only chicks from disease-free stock should be\\nused for broilers. Sickly chickens do not have the necessary stamina, and the\\nhigh percentage of loss through death wipes out the profits.Raising Rabbits for Their Wool\\nD\\nO YOU know that rabbit fur is dyed and used in the manufacture of synthetic\\nsealskin coats? Well, it is, and it offers one more way for a wide-awake\\nperson to make a thousand dollars. Blanch Krabill, of Toledo, Ohio, had been\\nraising rabbits for their pelts which she had been selling to a tannery at a\\nprofit. However, she discovered that she could make about as much money\\nby shearing the rabbits for their wool instead of using the whole pelt. Her\\nhutches now contain nine hundred rabbits which supply rabbit wool for\\ncommercial purposes.\\n“I hated to kill the rabbits for their pelts,” Blanch said, “because I became so\\nattached to them. But I had so many of them and they multiplied so rapidly\\nthat I could not afford to keep them. I had to get money out of them some\\nway and when a friend suggested shearing them and selling their fur for\\nwool, my problem was solved. Rabbit fur is softer than lamb’s wool, and not\\nso greasy. My problem was to find out if there was a demand for the wool\\nand, upon making inquiries, I learned about the rabbit’s commercial value as\\na wool producer. The Angora, with its unusually long silky hair, is the ideal\\nrabbit for wool production. There are regular markets for this wool in all big\\ncities, such as Detroit, Chicago and New York. Upon making this discovery,\\nI sheared the rabbits and shipped the wool to the nearest market.\\n“Rabbit wool is used for any number of things, such as knitting sweaters,\\nbaby clothes, muffs, scarfs and dresses. It makes a beautiful yarn which has\\nthe strength and durability of regular sheep wool although it is much finer\\nand softer. I receive a dollar and forty cents a pound for this wool and shear\\nthe rabbits four times a year. The Angora rabbit is unusually large, and each\\none produces about one and one-quarter pounds of wool yearly.”\\nThe rabbit is one of the most easily raised of all the furbearing animals and as\\nmany as five hundred rabbits may be successfully raised in your own back\\nyard. They are not subject to vermin of any kind, and resist practically allailments. Success requires only ordinary attention to sanitation and cleaning\\nthe rabbit hutches regularly. The cost of raising rabbits in quantities of a\\nhundred or more is about ten cents a rabbit.\\nMiss Krabill gives this suggestion on breeding to those interested in raising\\nrabbits. Secure two bred does and a buck from a reliable breeder who will\\nguarantee them to be healthy, pedigreed stock. Specify that the buck must be\\nfrom a different litter than the does, so he may be used when breeding the\\ndoes’ litters later on. This precaution will enable you to mate the rabbits in\\nthe first and second litters without danger of inbreeding. Rabbits reproduce\\nprolifically, and with good stock to start, you soon will have a number of\\nanimals with salable pelts. You can dispose of them through a tannery or, if\\nyou prefer, shear them for their wool.\\n“Glad” Garden Brings Joy and Profit\\nE\\nIGHT years ago Lucretia Kays Hanson, of Mill Valley, California, was\\nconfronted with the problem of supporting five children and a husband whose\\nill health had forced him to quit business. Mrs. Hanson is five feet tall and\\nweighs a hundred pounds but she shouldered the burden without flinching. At\\nfirst she was a “jill” of all trades. Finally she applied for a job with the Mill\\nValley Record, a newspaper edited by two capable women. Perhaps women\\neditors are soft-hearted; anyway Mrs. Hanson got work in the office and has\\nbeen there ever since. Evenings she typed letters for a blind business man,\\ncoached in French, English and mathematics, and looked after her brood and\\nher nine-room house.\\nMeanwhile, Mr. Hanson busied himself with his hobby of raising gladioli. He\\nhad the knack and the “glads” responded by blossoming in gorgeous\\nprofusion. People were enthusiastic over their exceptional beauty and wanted\\nto buy, but Mr. Hanson gave the flowers away in great armfuls until his wife\\nsuggested: “If they want to buy why not sell?”\\nThey discussed commercial distribution and Mrs. Hanson called on the ownerof the town’s swankiest market. Would he put their gladioli in for sale? He\\nconsented, saying that flowers like theirs would be an asset. His only\\nstipulation was that they be arranged before the store opened.\\nMrs. Hanson got up still earlier six mornings a week and while the fresh\\nproduce was being set out she arranged masses of “glads” in tall vases. Fifty\\ndozen were sold the first month which added twenty-five dollars to the\\nHanson income. As the grocer refused a commission, Mrs. Hanson insisted\\nthat he take home all the flowers he wanted on Saturdays and whenever his\\nwife gave a party.\\nThe sale of bulbs followed naturally. Customers wanted certain varieties for\\ntheir gardens. One big seller was a pale yellow which has been named\\nBillionaire because of its great stalk and the profusion of blossoms,\\nsometimes twenty to a stalk. Billionaires were popular for wedding\\ndecorations and floral sprays.\\nIt wasn’t long before she found there was another outlet for the flowers.\\nAlthough several large nurseries are located in outlying districts, there is no\\nflorist in Mill Valley; consequently the undertaker sells sprays. In return for\\nservices rendered he taught Mrs. Hanson how to wire sprays and she began\\ngetting orders which brought from two dollars up.\\nSoon other ideas for getting orders presented themselves. A donation now\\nand then to the leading tea room brought orders for decorations when\\nbanquets were held there. A bouquet presented to the owner when a new\\nstore opened in town increased trade; so did an occasional advertisement in\\nthe Record. On one outstanding occasion red “glads” banked the platform of\\nthe San Francisco Civic Auditorium where ten thousand people gathered at\\nthe International Convention of the Christian Endeavor to celebrate that\\nsociety’s Golden Jubilee.\\n“Selling ‘glads’ has been fun, and although it hasn’t meant a fortune the\\nmoney has often been a godsend,” Mrs. Hanson remarks. “Besides, being\\ngainfully occupied has saved Mr. Hanson much worry and unhappiness.”\\nMaking Money from an Herb GardenA\\nLTHOUGH herb gardens are as old as history, the last generation in\\nAmerica seems to have neglected this type of gardening entirely. Of course,\\nwe use sage and celery salt in seasoning our cookery, but most of us have\\nforgotten the herbs our grandmothers and great-grandmothers knew and used\\ndaily in their kitchens.\\nRecently, however, there has been a revival of interest in the herb family and\\nonce again kitchens are giving off the delicious odors of foods seasoned with\\nthyme, marjoram, basil, and tarragon. While these herbs may not add to the\\nfood value of a dish, they do give it a savory flavor. Certain herbs, notably\\nlavender, are also used for scenting linen closets or chests. There are also the\\nmedicinal herbs which constitute a study in themselves.\\nMost herbs can be grown with little care if they are planted in good, well-\\nworked soil in a sunny spot. Midsummer is the time for collecting herbs from\\nthe garden. If cut before the flowers open, all the fragrance is retained in the\\ndried herbs. Not only is herb gardening a pleasant way to make money, but\\nthe study of herbs is a most fascinating subject. A woman in the East has\\nmade an excellent living with her garden of the rarer medicinal herbs which\\nshe sells to the pharmaceutical houses. Not only is her garden a financial\\nsuccess, but she has become an authority on medicinal herbs.\\nOne does not need a large space for an herb garden. Miss Helen Lyman of\\nOakland, California, has an herb garden, approximately 25 feet in diameter\\nwhich holds 30 varieties of herbs. Her little booklet entitled, “30 Herbs Will\\nMake an Herb Garden,” tells others how to succeed in this interesting\\nenterprise.\\nMarshall Field & Company, Chicago, the largest department store in the\\nworld, now has a department devoted entirely to herbs for use in cookery,\\nmedicine and perfume. The herbs are imported from an herb farm more than\\na century old which is located near Kent, England. Among the products\\nhandled by Field’s herb department are the old-fashioned pomander balls just\\nlike those our grandmothers hung in their clothespresses. All the well-knownherbs are available, several types of vinegars, jellies with special herb\\nflavoring, and cosmetics prepared from certain beneficial herbs. A small shelf\\nof 10 selected kitchen herbs is sold as a unit. Mixed salad herbs are also sold\\nby ounce or half ounce.\\nMany a woman who has a sunny corner in her garden could develop an herb\\ngarden specializing either in medicinal or in kitchen herbs. If she is known\\nfor her jellies and jams, she can combine two interesting occupations and,\\nincidentally, make jellies so unusual that they will bring higher prices. The\\nbetter food specialty shops offer an outlet for such products.\\nThere are several books on the subject of herb growing and most of the\\ngarden magazines have published articles about people who “herb garden.”\\nThe details of such gardening are simple enough for any man or woman to\\nfollow and success in this field is dependent only upon the energy and\\ninitiative of the individual gardener.\\nRaising Goldfish for Premiums\\nB\\nACK in 1900, Eugene C. Shireman was selling washing powder for a\\ncompany which had hit upon the bright idea of offering a small bowl and a\\npair of goldfish as a premium. This premium idea worked so well that they\\nsoon ran out of goldfish and Shireman decided to turn a swamp, which he had\\nreceived as a legacy years ago, into a fish farm and sell his crop to the\\ncompany. He stocked his pool with two hundred goldfish which multiplied\\nrapidly. But by the time he was turning out sufficient fish to sell, the\\ncompany had gone out of business. However, there were other outlets, and\\ntoday the fish are sold through five-and-ten stores, pet shops, chain stores,\\ndrug stores, florists, department stores, etc. The various State Departments\\nare also a market for goldfish which are used extensively in mosquito control\\nwork. The goldfish, which belong to the carp family, are exceedingly fond of\\nthe mosquito larvae and will clear a stagnant pond of water of these pests in\\nno time.From a small start with 200 fish in 1900, Eugene Shireman has developed the\\nfamous Grassyfork Fisheries at Martinsville, Indiana, and has raised over\\n75,000,000 fish. Grassyfork Fisheries consist of 1,500 acres of gently rolling\\nhills and give employment to 125 persons. There are 615 ponds as well as\\n216 hatching tanks. The ponds and tanks are terraced so that they can be fed\\nwith a continuous circuit of fresh water from the numerous springs located on\\nthe property.\\nOne hundred and sixty thousand carefully selected goldfish are reserved as\\nbreeding stock at the Grassyfork hatcheries. Branch shipping points are\\nmaintained at Chicago, Illinois, and Saddle River, New Jersey. From\\nMartinsville the goldfish are shipped via a fleet of tank trucks. From Chicago\\nand Saddle River the fish are shipped to the customers, via express, in\\npeculiar, globe-shaped shipping cans. In addition to the goldfish, the\\nGrassyfork hatcheries also raise some forty varieties of toy tropical fish\\nwhich have recently become so popular, such as Gouramis, the live-bearing\\nGuppies, Helleri, and other species. As these fish are less hardy than the\\ncommon goldfish, the tanks in which they are raised are located indoors in\\ngreenhouses. An important part of this business is the aquatic plant\\ndepartment. About sixty varieties of water lilies are raised, besides\\nperennials, marsh and bog plants, and all the other items necessary, to add\\nbeauty to pools and rock gardens.\\nThe price for goldfish runs from a nickel apiece for small common goldfish\\nto $25 apiece for the relatively rare Moor “telescopes.” The most interesting\\ngoldfish and also the most valuable specimen ever seen in America was the\\nfamous Liberty Bond fish which was exhibited during the World War. The\\ncolors of this fish were red, white and blue and it was used to attract crowds\\nduring Liberty Loan drives of 1917 and 1918. The value placed on it at that\\ntime was $10,000.\\nThere is still a big market for goldfish among merchants and other business\\nmen who use them as premiums. The L. Fish Furniture Company, of\\nChicago, built its business, one of the largest in the world, that way. Fish\\nfurniture is sold on the installment plan. When a customer gets her account\\nalmost paid up, she is called upon by a salesman who presents her with abowl of goldfish with “Mr. Fish’s compliments.” That breaks the ice. The\\nsalesman then proceeds to find out if the customer has an electric refrigerator.\\nIf not, he sells her one—on the installment plan, of course. If she has a\\nrefrigerator, he sells her a washing machine or some other electric appliance.\\nIn this way the company’s customers are kept on the books year after year.\\nCleaning Up on Turkeys\\nW\\nHEN Mrs. Paul Engle, of Pulaski County, Indiana, decided to raise turkeys\\ninstead of chickens, she didn’t realize the “clean-up” she was going to make.\\n“Everybody was raising chickens,” Mrs. Engle said, “but only a few were\\npaying attention to turkeys. So I began with turkeys on a small scale. In 1933\\nwe had a thousand turkeys which we sold at Christmas time at twenty cents a\\npound, and we were well satisfied with our profits.” As the average turkey\\nran to a little over ten pounds and her cost for each of the birds was about 50\\ncents, she had a profit of about $1,400 for that one season.\\nThe work connected with the care and raising of the turkey poults did not\\nbother Mrs. Engle in the least. “Work,” she said, “is a tonic for anybody.”\\nShe converted the former chicken house on the farm into a large turkey\\nhouse. It was a big job but proved worth the effort. As she places day-old\\npoults in this turkey house, everything connected with it must be kept safe\\nand sanitary. Before placing the baby poults in the old chicken house, the\\nfloor, which is cement, was scrubbed with lye water. Every piece of\\nequipment was cleaned and scrubbed, and the house fumigated. A sun pen\\nwas built just outside this chicken house. The sun pen was a collapsible\\naffair, arranged so that it could be quickly taken down, and put out of the\\nway. It consisted of frames covered with wire, and cost but little to make. In\\ngood weather, the young poults were permitted to run in this sun pen. After\\nthe oats harvest was completed, the turkey poults were turned into a small oat\\nfield, which was used as a turkey range.\\nThe entire cost of rearranging the chicken house and building the turkey pen\\nwas less than $100. Mrs. Engle did not buy brooders and incubators for theturkey poults, but utilized the equipment on the premises which had been\\nused for raising chickens.\\nSanitation, Mrs. Engle believes, is an all-important element in successful\\nturkey raising. Too much care cannot be given the pens to keep them free\\nfrom infectious diseases. Once a week she has clean straw spread on the\\nfloors of the turkey house after soiled bedding is removed. When anyone\\nenters the turkey house where the young poults are kept, he must put on\\nrubber boots that have been thoroughly disinfected just before entering. “We\\ncannot be too careful about this,” Mrs. Engle explained. “Without such\\nprecaution, blackhead infection could be tracked in from the ground over\\nwhich the chickens have run.”\\nAlthough Mrs. Engle has increased the number of turkeys on the farm to\\nabout three thousand, the cost of raising each poult has steadily decreased\\nuntil now it is close to 27 cents each. She emphasizes the fact that it is not the\\ncost of feeding which checks profits, but careless handling. Careless handling\\ncauses the poults to die from disease and then the crop goes “into the red.”\\nDay-old poults may be secured from one of the big poultry farms at very\\nsmall cost. A small turkey flock does not require a big area for ranging, for as\\nmany as 100 birds may be brought to maturity on an average city lot. Such\\nbirds are carefully shipped either by parcel post or by express, and with\\nordinary care 90 per cent will mature for market, giving a high percentage of\\nprofit to the raiser.\\nRaisingIrishTerriers\\nW\\nHAT you can do with the hobby you have acquired has been demonstrated\\nby Jules Beaumont, who a few years ago acquired the lease of a garage on the\\nrear of a building lot near Chicago’s “Gold Coast” and started his own\\nkennels. Beaumont had been given two pedigreed Irish Terriers, and was so\\nattached to them that he had rented the vacant garage property as a home for\\nthe dogs and their puppies. People in the neighborhood noticed the fine breedand form of the animals, and stopped to buy the puppies. He held his prices\\nhigh, not caring whether he sold them or not. Before he realized it, he was in\\nthe money in a big way, averaging better than three hundred a month from\\nthe sale of blooded dogs and supplies to dog owners.\\n“I am touching on a controversial subject when I mention dog intelligence,”\\ndeclared Beaumont, “but I believe the owners of Irish Terriers will agree that\\nthey are about the most intelligent of the dog kingdom. These terriers I had at\\nthe beginning had good pedigrees, and they never failed to attract the\\nattention of anyone passing the kennels. One day a woman wanted one so\\nbadly for her boy, then about fifteen, that I couldn’t resist selling it, though I\\ndidn’t want to. In the end she paid a hundred and fifty dollars for it. I thought\\nthat was a lot of money at the time, so let her have it. I had four puppies of\\nthe Irish Terrier breed, but within a week, friends of that woman had called,\\nand each insisted on getting one of those puppies. As orders came in for the\\npups of the next litters, I decided to go into dog breeding. At this time, I\\ndidn’t have any money left that I could invest in additional dogs, so I cared\\nfor and watched over those I had. When the litters came in, I noticed the\\npeople who had ordered. I made enough from the sale of the dogs to break\\neven during the first six months, and got a good profit out of the sale of\\naccessories, such as dog food, harnesses, leashes, and dog medicines.\\n“There were other sources of profit. Few people can see a cute puppy without\\nhandling it a great deal. Some make it play until it’s tired. Others feed it too\\nmuch. The pup, therefore, from well meant overdoses of kindness in one\\ndirection or another, becomes run down, and suffers from various types of\\nillness. In addition, pups are subject to worms, and frequently the owner\\nneglects to worm them. The result is a sluggish, sick puppy. These are but a\\nfew of the abuses a dog receives almost from the day it is bought. As the\\nkennel from which the dog was secured is the first place the owner goes for\\nadvice and treatment, one soon accumulates side lines that are profitable, and\\ncost but little. For instance, many dogs that are seemingly ill only need to be\\nplaced in a warm dry spot and left without food for a day or so. This\\ntreatment means little or no expense to the kennel, but, of course, the owner\\nis glad to pay well for getting his dog back in good condition.“As a rule, a litter will have two males or more and one or two females. The\\nmales are always in big demand and bring good prices; the females are\\ngenerally lower priced. The females from my first litters were sold, but I kept\\nthose from subsequent litters for breeding, and in two years have greatly\\nincreased the productivity of the kennels. Later I added other popular breeds\\nas I found there are certain breeds of dogs which capture the public favor and\\nfor which people will pay more money than others. In this group are the\\nSealyham, Pekingese, Pomeranian, Wire-haired Fox Terrier, Dalmatian, and\\nsome Collies.\\n“Many believe that it requires a lot of money to start a kennel. This, however,\\nis a myth. I never had much money until after I had a good start in the kennel\\nbusiness. As a matter of fact, my total investment for blooded stock was less\\nthan three hundred dollars. It cost me about seventy dollars to turn the\\nabandoned garage into a suitable kennel for dog breeding. I discovered that\\nwhile you may have little trouble selling a few puppies to people who pass\\nyour kennels, you have to do a little merchandising to sell a good many dogs.\\nI use the easiest method, which is holding a dog show at the kennels. I don’t\\nplace dogs I have for sale in these kennel shows, but enter only the dogs of\\nmy customers and their friends. Those who condition their dogs properly are\\nthe owners who receive the blue and gold ribbons. These dog shows not only\\nattract new customers, but also increase the sale of supplies and accessories.\\nThey are open to all blooded dogs whose owners care to enter them.”\\nYou may start an Irish Terrier kennel in your home. A good female is usually\\nall the stock you need to start, and may be purchased for around forty to fifty\\ndollars. When old enough, she may be put at stud with a pedigreed male at\\none of the first-class kennels. The fee for studding is usually one male of the\\nlitter. By retaining the females of each litter, you soon will be able to have a\\nnumber of puppies for sale. If you are unable to get good prices yourself or\\nwant to sell wholesale only, any kennel, recognized by the American Kennel\\nClub, will buy your puppies and resell them for you.\\nQuickProfitsfromMushroomsW\\nHEN Laz Lewin made up his mind to start a business of his own he decided\\nto do something different. Learning that mushrooms may be profitably grown\\nin cellars, sheds, barns or garages, Lewin bought a small quantity of\\nmushroom spawn, rigged up a mushroom bed in his cellar, and started to\\nraise mushrooms. This wasn’t a new idea. Home cultivation of mushrooms\\nhas been attempted for many years, but during the past few years new\\nmethods have been developed which greatly increase the profits in this\\nbusiness. It was a new idea in Memphis, Tennessee, Lewin’s home town,\\nhowever, and his venture won quick approval from local storekeepers,\\nrestaurants, cafes and similar establishments.\\n“I never saw a mushroom grow before I started raising mushrooms,”\\nadmitted Lewin. “I was somewhat surprised at the suddenness of their\\ngrowth, and realized the meaning of the old ‘saw’—‘grows like a\\nmushroom.’ I started with a mushroom bed one hundred feet in area. It cost\\nme two dollars to make this bed, ten feet by ten. Then I ordered the seed, or\\n‘spawn’ as it is called by mushroom growers. When it reached me, it looked\\nlike a mass of tangled white threads. I planted it, carefully following\\ninstructions, and two weeks later a white substance, appearing like cobwebs,\\ncovered the bed. Over this I spread ordinary back-yard dirt, and waited for\\nanother three weeks. One morning, upon going into the cellar to look at this\\nbed, I was amazed to see it covered with baby mushrooms. This was a\\nsurprise, for nothing had been there the night before. ,I wondered how long it\\nwould take to develop these baby mushrooms for market, but the next day,\\nwhen I saw the mushrooms had increased in size ten times, I picked them. I\\naveraged a little over two and one-half pounds per square foot for the one\\nhundred square feet in the bed and sold this entire crop to local markets at an\\naverage price of forty-five cents a pound.\\n“My investment in spawn was slightly over eight dollars which, with the two\\ndollars for making the bed, comprised my total cost. I received approximately\\n$110 for my crops.\\n“It was then I fully realized what a profit there could be in raisingmushrooms. I increased my mushroom beds with the profit from this first\\ncrop and soon had one thousand square feet in production. At forty-five cents\\na pound, I easily sold the entire crop. As I have no rent, overhead, special\\nequipment, or marketing expenses, I enjoy an advantage over the commercial\\ngrower.\\n“Up to that time, the local market held up well, and there appeared to be no\\nreason why I should not increase my growing space. Many of the companies\\nfrom which spawn is purchased are also commission merchants with branch\\nmushroom receiving stations located throughout the country. Some of the\\ncompanies will agree to purchase all the mushrooms produced by home\\ngrowers and resell them to local stores. This, of course, helps the grower to\\nsecure a ready market for his product at the current wholesale market price.\\nMoreover, they pay the shipping charges on shipments of five pounds or\\nmore. With an assured market I increased the size of my mushroom beds,\\nusing more of the space formerly wasted about my home. The pure white\\nvariety of patented mushroom I have been raising brings top prices for my\\ncrops. I was lucky, I guess, when I picked out this particular variety.”\\nMushrooms are easily raised as they require but little attention. Sunshine not\\nbeing essential to their development, they will grow as well under the cellar\\nstairs as in a pleasantly lighted room. In fact, bright sunlight is really not\\ndesirable according to experienced growers. The market for mushrooms is\\nwide and profitable. The ability to supply fresh stock at all times, and give\\nquick delivery service, insures attractive profits.\\nThe cost of “spawn” for raising a pound of mushrooms varies between four\\nand one-half and six cents. Persons shipping to wholesale and commission\\nhouses find sufficient profit margin between the prices received and their\\nactual cost, to operate profitably. Generally, the best plan is to sell some of\\nyour crop in your own community, at higher prices, and to ship the\\nremainder.\\nPractically any mushroom spawn today will grow in ordinary cellars or sheds\\nwherever it is possible to maintain a fairly even temperature. The temperature\\nshould be from 55 to 70 degrees according to the period of growth of thespawn.\\nAdvertising Makes Farm Pay\\nI\\nT WAS not until the Arthur Wolf Farms, Tippecanoe County, Indiana,\\nerected “want ad” signs, that business really did pick up. These signs are the\\nbillboard type and bear the name, post office and telephone address of the\\nfarm at the top. Under this information are two columns with the headings,\\n“For Sale” and “Want to Buy.” These columns are so arranged that the farmer\\ncan insert listings which are painted on removable sheets of metal. Whenever\\nthe farm has something to offer or is in the market to buy, Mr. Riley, the\\nmanager, inserts the proper metal strips under the correct headings. Under the\\n“For Sale” heading will be such items as mules, sheep, clover hay, bred gilts,\\noats, alfalfa, shoats, feeding cattle, machinery, hay feeders, hay corn, etc.\\nWhenever Mr. Wolf needs any kind of hay, live stock, clover or alfalfa hay,\\noats, hogs, etc., a sign specifying the need is put up under the heading, “Want\\nto Buy.”\\nAs Mr. Wolf’s live stock operations are rather extensive, and there are many\\ncattle and hogs to feed, there are times when he needs hay or corn. Then he\\nwill buy from anyone passing on the highway who sees his sign and has the\\nright product to sell him. When the farm is short of stock and long on feed,\\nthe truckers become the buyers. The last crop of turkeys and hogs was all\\nsold by this sign. Whenever there is a surplus of any stock or produce, the\\nsign usually sells it in a few days. From time to time, feeder cattle or hay may\\nbe auctioned in the field. The sign tells the passer-by several days ahead of\\ntime about the auction. Two signs are in use all the time on this farm of 1,050\\nacres—one on each side of the place where the highway intersects the\\nproperty line.\\nIs there an idea here for a business of your own in selling and installing signs\\nlike these for the wide-awake farmers in your locality?\\nchapter fIVe\\nTHINGS TO INVENT AND PATENTT\\nHE closer your business comes to being a monopoly the surer you will be of\\nsuccess. Here in America there is a good deal of confusion over the meaning\\nof “monopoly.” To some people it means taking advantage of small\\ncompetitors by unfair practices. But since the days of Elizabethan charters\\nand patents, a monopoly has meant protection against competition.\\nSometimes a monopoly was granted by the state in the form of a patent or\\ngrant, but more often it was obtained by the business man or tradesman by\\nvirtue of his membership in a “guild.” The last official act signed by Queen\\nElizabeth was to annul the British Monopolies Act.\\nWhat forms of monopoly do we find in American business? First we have the\\n“trust” or holding company which enjoys a monopoly by virtue of buying out\\nall its competitors, thus giving itself a clear field to charge all the traffic will\\nbear. Such monopoly is based on financial power. It is a pistol pointed at the\\nheart of the small, independent business man. It is the type of monopoly\\nwhich Theodore Roosevelt attempted to crush with his trust-busting\\nactivities. Some business men still believe his method is the answer to\\nruthless competition. The use of such power to obtain a trade monopoly is\\nun-American in its conception, uneconomic if carried to its logical\\nconclusion, and would inevitably lead to a monopoly of monopolies and\\nfinally monopolize the functions of government.\\nBut there is another kind of monopoly fostered by the government, which is\\njust as much in the public interest as the other sort of monopoly is against it.\\nUnder that classification comes the monopoly of skill. That is the best\\nmonopoly of all. It is the monopoly that is enjoyed by the man who can build\\na better mouse trap or paint a better picture, write a better book, design a\\nbetter dress or excel in any field. The very fact that you can do one little thing\\nbetter than anyone else in the world can do it, assures your success. And\\nalthough the monopoly granted for one achievement is limited as to duration,\\nthe success will continue so long as you make good your monopoly by\\nkeeping ahead of the imitators who are always found in the wake of success.\\nThen, there is the monopoly that comes from location. For example, it is awell-known fact that on the Island of Bermuda, a certain group of people\\npretty well control the island. These “best” families protect native business\\nmen against the encroachment of newcomers who seek to exploit the island.\\nHow do they do it? Very simply. You go over to Bermuda on a trip, fall in\\nlove with the climate and decide to start an automobile agency there. It looks\\nlike an easy way to make a few thousand dollars. Statistics show that the\\nnumber of inhabitants per automobile is higher in Bermuda than in any other\\nplace in or around the United States. It looks like a wide-open opportunity.\\nSo you get an agency and hang out your shingle in Hamilton. But nothing\\nhappens. The first thing you find is that only government officials are\\nlicensed to drive automobiles on the island, that residents there don’t want the\\nsmelly things rushing about killing people. Next you learn that it is not\\nconsidered good form in Bermuda to patronize any business that has not the\\napproval of the “best” families. Bermuda is a small place, and one who lives\\nthere feels the need of social contacts. People who patronize the “wrong”\\nbusiness men suffer a sudden social catastrophe. In that way a monopoly is\\ngranted to those whom the older families wish to have succeed, and failure\\nusually overtakes those who try to “muscle in.”\\nAnother form of monopoly is to get an exclusive concession at a fair, or the\\nexclusive local agency for some advertised product. When Eskimo ice cream\\nbars were first put on the market, men paid fancy prices just for a local\\nfranchise to make these bars and sell them to the public. The “rights” to sell\\nNeon signs in a territory were sold to eager salesmen at prices ranging from\\n$1,000 to $15,000. The Coca-Cola Company is another well-known concern\\nwhich gives exclusive franchises to sales agents. It is worth noting, however,\\nthat in nearly every case where the sale of franchises has been used to finance\\na business, a large part of the money received for the franchises was used to\\npay for the initial advertising campaign. While there are cases of men selling\\npatent rights to raise money it is a difficult and usually a disappointing\\nmethod of financing a new business.\\nWhat Goes with a Patent\\nMost inexperienced people feel that if they invent something and are able to\\nget it patented, they can make a thousand dollars very quickly, either byselling the patent on a royalty basis, or by selling the patent outright. They\\nassume that because they have a patent, they have the federal government\\nback of them to keep off poachers and pirates. There is danger in placing too\\nmuch reliance on, and attaching too much importance to, a patent until it has\\nbeen tested in a high court.\\nFor example, a number of advertising men have “invented” trick mailing\\ncards, letters which fold down from the top, or some other device, and have\\napplied for, and been granted, patents on these things. In many cases they\\nhave, on the strength of such patents, collected royalties from printers and\\nothers for the use of the idea. One large lithographer paid several thousand\\ndollars for a patent on a folded-down letterhead, the patent covering any\\nletterhead which had printing under the flap. There was nothing wrong with\\nthe patent. But if this patent claim was appealed to the U. S. Supreme Court\\nan infringement suit would probably be dismissed on the grounds that the\\npatent covered an operation which was natural to a mechanic in the pursuit of\\nhis trade. English common law gives a mechanic definite protection, just as it\\nprotects business men from confiscation of capital without due process of\\nlaw; and the question of whether a patent is for a real invention and not mere\\nmechanical skill must be left to the judgment of the courts in view of\\nevidence introduced on both sides of the controversy.\\nThere is also the possibility of somebody being able to show prior use of\\nanything you may patent. A patent was recently granted for a “pop-up” idea\\nin collection folders. It appeared to be a perfectly good patent, and hundreds\\nof companies are paying the inventor a royalty for the use of the idea. Yet it\\nis possible that this idea was used in valentines many years before its present\\nuse in folders. If somebody wanted to go to the trouble of searching among\\ncollections of old valentines and found a sufficiently similar idea, the patent\\ncould be invalidated by proving that it was not an original idea, and therefore\\nthe inventor was not entitled to the benefits of a government monopoly.\\nAnother hazard that goes with patents is the possibility of some person\\n“improving” upon your patent or otherwise changing it just enough to get\\naround your patent claims. The idea, of course, is to make the claim as broad\\nand as inclusive as possible, but because of earlier patents or printedpublications, the claims must be limited to only the advance in the art which\\nthe inventor had made. Sometimes the only thing that can be patented is an\\naccessory. That is why in taking out a patent you should go to a reputable and\\nexperienced firm of patent attorneys and stay clear of quacks who advertise\\nfor “suckers.” You will pay a reputable patent attorney a little more than the\\nquack’s advertised price, but the reputable attorney will tell you frankly if\\nyour invention is practical and may even be able to help you to market it.\\nStrangely enough, most of the outstanding inventions were made by\\n“outsiders.” The principle of the steam engine, as everybody knows, was\\ndiscovered by James Watt, who got the idea watching the lid of a teakettle\\njump up and down. It suggested to him the existence of power in steam, and\\nhe set about in his crude way figuring out how that power could be harnessed.\\nOut of that invention came our present industrial system.\\nBenjamin Franklin was not an electrician, but he invented the lightning rod.\\nThe Eastman Kodak Company paid a hundred thousand dollars to a man who\\ninvented the device which enables you to write on the back of a film after it is\\nexposed. And even the humble brake on a baby carriage was not invented, as\\nyou might suppose, by a carriage manufacturer, but by an advertising man in\\nsearch of an “exclusive” feature to advertise.\\nSo do not feel that just because you do not know all there is to know about a\\nparticular product that you cannot find ways to improve it. Strangely enough,\\na person who is using a thing is often the one to think of an improvement,\\nrather than the man who makes it, and the maker is eager to pay him either a\\nlump sum of cash for the patent or a royalty on it. Improving the appliances\\nand things that you use in your daily work is perhaps the easiest and most\\npractical way to make money on patents. It is not much of a trick to get\\n$1,000 from a large manufacturer for any worth-while improvement which\\nyou develop and patent. There are a hundred ways to make a thousand dollars\\nright in the kitchen of your home. In spite of the thousands of existing patents\\nthere is still a need of a better can opener, a better clothespin, a better bottle\\nopener, and other simple everyday things that are in daily use.\\nAs a rule, simple inventions are the most profitable. The hump hairpin is acase in point. For years women had been using and losing straight hairpins.\\nThe pins fell out of the hair because there was nothing to hold them in. Then\\nsome bright fellow thought about putting a little kink in the wire. It was so\\nsimple it seemed unimportant. Yet a great business has been built up in\\nChicago, and millions of dollars have been made on “hump” hairpins.\\nOn the other hand, this same chap might have spent years inventing a dish-\\nwashing machine, only to find after inventing it that people had to be\\neducated to wash dishes by machine and that there were already a dozen on\\nthe market. If you are of an inventive or deductive turn of mind, and have an\\nambition to make some money on a patent, first be sure your market exists\\nbefore spending time and money on an invention.\\nOf the large number of patents issued annually, many are taken out by\\ncorporations to protect their development work in improving upon their\\nproducts, or their production methods and apparatus, which have already\\nbeen more or less approved in the market. Often corporations will also take\\nout patents on alternatives or substitutes which they do not intend to exploit,\\nbut merely to hold, to forestall competitors adopting them. But of the other\\npatents—those issued to “free lance” inventors—perhaps nine out of ten\\npatents are on inventions which prove to be of practically no commercial\\nimportance. Generally, this is not so much because the invention lacks merit\\nas because there is an inadequate commercial field for it. There are many\\nreasons why the commercial field for an invention may be inadequate.\\nExpense of manufacture may be too great to bring the selling price of the\\ninvention down to profitable production. The cost of merchandising may be\\ntoo great in cases where the article invented cannot be standardized and\\nrequires too large an assortment of stock.\\nOften the invention involves a meritorious idea for the particular situations\\nfor which it was designed, but the possible users are too few and too scattered\\nto make it practicable to contact and sell them economically. This is\\nparticularly true of accessories usable only on particular makes and models of\\nautomobiles or on certain types and makes of domestic boilers.\\nIn other instances the cost to a manufacturer of taking over an invention anddeveloping it until it is ready for production may promise to involve so much\\nexpenditure that it is difficult to get a manufacturer interested. It is often the\\nhigh cost of development (which along with the royalty to the inventor must\\ncome out of the manufacturing profits) which reduces the revenue an inventor\\nmight otherwise get on his patent. Thus, in inventions where the probable\\ncost of development is the least, the inventor has the best chance of realizing\\na large royalty or lump sum payment for his patent.\\nThese difficulties are reviewed not for the purpose of discouraging you from\\nmaking money by inventing something, but rather to point out other factors\\nthan the merit of the invention itself or how well it works, in deciding\\nwhether you are going to devote your time and money to a particular\\ninvention you may have in mind.\\nThe Cost of Taking Out a Patent\\nThe cost of securing a patent is one factor of expense which ought to be\\nbalanced against the probable reward for your efforts in the event of success,\\nand you must take into consideration that an invention is something of a\\ngamble until the merit of the invention has been demonstrated, and your\\npatent upheld in the courts. To a certain extent the cost of securing a patent\\ndepends upon how complicated the machine or device is. But, on the other\\nhand, the very simplicity of some inventions makes them more expensive to\\npatent because the attorney has to spend more time in presenting arguments\\nto the Patent Office to overcome the objection that because the invention is\\nsimple it is seemingly obvious. It is seldom possible to have an attorney\\nprepare and file an application for you for less than $100, including the cost\\nof the Patent Office drawings and the government filing fee of $30. A worth-\\nwhile patent nearly always involves some cost of prosecution in getting the\\npatent through the Patent Office after it has been filed, and before the patent\\nis finally issued another $30 must be paid to the government as a final fee.\\nThe total cost of securing a patent, on even the simplest inventions, will be at\\nleast $140 or $150 in most instances. Even the average invention will be a\\nlittle more expensive than this to patent, and if the invention is unusually\\ncomplicated, the cost of the Patent Office drawings and the time which the\\nattorney will have to devote to the proper preparation of the application andclaims, may increase the total cost of securing such a patent to $300 or even\\nmore. Because your income from the invention will probably be due almost\\nentirely to the patent protection you get, it is well to have the services of a\\ncompetent patent attorney in procuring your patent, as often the value of the\\npatent depends largely upon the skill of the attorney. It is wise to have your\\npatent procured by an attorney of recognized ability, although some other\\nattorney might prepare your application for a lower fee. Incidentally, you will\\nfind that being able to confer directly with your patent attorney is going to be\\nof considerable value to you.\\nImprovements Are the Most SalablePatents\\nT\\nHE best way to make money on inventions is to devise improvements for\\nthings which you use every day. As a rule manufacturers are anxious to\\nimprove their products and will pay substantial sums for ideas along those\\nlines.\\nTake the ordinary kitchen mixer, for example. It does many things, but it is\\nsafe to say that there are a hundred and one undiscovered uses for this\\ncommon home appliance. There are several manufacturers of such appliances\\nand competition between them is keen. An attachment to increase the use of\\nthe mixer, which one of these manufacturers could feature exclusively, would\\nbe a valuable sales point.\\nSimilarly, it is possible to improve the most simple things. A good example is\\nthe ordinary tube of tooth paste. The tube was an improvement over the sift-\\ntop can, just as the sift-top can was an improvement over the can of soap\\nwhich our fathers used. Yet the tube leaves much to be desired. It is unhandy,\\nit is a nuisance, and it is unsanitary. What will the next improvement be? Will\\nit be some simple dispenser, similar to the soap dispensers on Pullman cars,\\nwhich can be built into a medicine cabinet or the washstand and always be\\nready for use? Somebody thought of wall dispensers for Italian Balm, and it\\nbecame one of the most important parts of the sales plan of that company.There are many other opportunities for improving the things that we use in\\nthe home, in the garden and office, if one is observing enough to see them\\nand ingenious enough to figure out a way to add improvements. Of course, if\\nyou are experienced in a certain field, you have a particular advantage in\\nbeing able to invent improvements that apply especially to that area of\\nactivity. There is nothing so perfect in this world that it cannot be improved;\\nnothing so well done that it cannot be done better. The man who thinks that\\nwe have progressed so far that everything worth while has been thought of\\nwill awake to find that nothing is static, but that the fertile brain of man is\\nconstantly finding a way to do everything better.\\nOf course there are opportunities—many of them—for inventing new things\\nto fill a long-felt want. But the development and marketing of such inventions\\nis at best uncertain. The story is told of the man who invented a knife and\\nfork for a one-handed person, and in his enthusiasm had thousands\\nmanufactured. He learned too late that there were not enough onehanded\\npeople to use them and that it would cost so much to create a demand that he\\nwould have to charge more for his product than the average one-handed\\nperson would pay. Had he spent the same time and effort on improving\\nsomething for which a known demand existed the loss of both time and\\nmoney might have been saved.\\nBertPond’sHobbyEnded Up in a Business\\nW\\nHILE Bert Pond was still a high-school boy in Chicago, he became\\ninterested in model airplanes and joined the Illinois Model Aero Club. This\\nairplane research group, he believed, was far ahead of the rest of the world in\\nthe study of miniature flying craft of all kinds. While he attended Illinois U,\\nhe continued to make many midget planes and often paid his fraternity house\\nbills with cash prizes he won at national exhibits.\\nIt was after Lindbergh’s flight, however, when the country became aviation-\\nconscious, that he began to cash in on his knowledge of model airplanes. He\\nresigned his job with the Minneapolis-Honeywell Corporation and decided tobuild and help others build model airplanes. His first work was instructing\\nclasses in model airplane design at Y. M. C. A. meetings, Boy Scout camps,\\nand at various schools all over Indiana. He next wrote a series of articles on\\nmodel airplanes for Popular Aviation, Popular Science Monthly, and other\\npublications of this type. It wasn’t long before the students in all these classes\\nand the readers of his articles wanted materials to make their own models. So\\nhis next step was to make these materials which were so much in demand.\\nIn his model airplane shop, Peru, Indiana, he began to manufacture not only a\\nmidget motor and a 6½ ounce gasoline motor, but also the familiar rubber-\\nband twisters and other parts and accessories for fans who build their own\\nmodels. He later supplied the featherweight wood called balsa, which is used\\nfor airplane models, Japanese silk tissue, special cements, and fresh rubber to\\npower the planes. He also manufactured a low-priced scale used to weigh\\nparts for the models down to 1/1000 of an ounce, and a miniature true pitch\\npropeller. Thousands of these little propellers were turned out for other\\nminiature aircraft companies. His shop also designed model kits and made\\nready-built planes for other concerns. In the last few years, the shop has sold\\nmany hundreds of thousands of planes in the fiveand-ten stores.\\nRegular orders kept this shop busy the year round, but during certain rush\\nperiods the shop ran night and day. During the three or four major national\\ncontests held each year, there was a gratifying increase in orders. Bert Pond’s\\nsuccess with his hobby suggests the value of developing an interesting hobby\\nwhich some day may provide your bread and butter— and perhaps a little\\njam.\\nAnother hobby which later became a real vocation was that of H. E. Boucher.\\nAs a little boy, Mr. Boucher frequently made little boats which were the envy\\nof his playmates. His parents had planned his entire education to the end that\\nhe would some day become a naval architect. He did reach this goal but his\\nhobby persisted in taking all his spare time and soon he found that he was\\nmaking many miniature ships for his friends. The demand increased and\\npresently his “real” work was being crowded out of his life by his hobby. It\\nwas then that he decided to stop fighting against his interest in this hobby and\\nhe organized the H. E. Boucher Manufacturing Company. The market for hisproducts was provided by the hundreds of other hobbyists interested in\\nminiature ships and ship parts. Eventually what started out as a hobby\\nbecame one of the largest businesses of its kind.\\nElectrical Toy Sells Out State Street\\nF\\nOR perhaps a year or more, an editor on a Chicago business publication had\\nbeen working on an electrical toy. At first glance, there seemed to be nothing\\nremarkable about this toy. When you picked it up you thought it just another\\n“Jack-in-the-box.” When the little hook holding “Jack” in the box was lifted,\\nhowever, there really was a surprise in store for you. “Jack” had two big\\nelectrical eyes which lit up fiery red when he popped out of the box!\\nWhen the toy was ready for market, the editor, who had had considerable\\nselling experience, decided to take it around to the store buyers himself. This\\nwas in September. By the middle of November he had sold every store on\\nState Street, except the largest, whose toy buyer had been too busy to give the\\ntoy any real study. The small factory handling the production of the toy had\\nmade up the quantity the inventor thought would sell the first holiday season.\\nBut now demands for the toy came from outlying stores and also from the\\n“big” store. However, he had made the profit he had set out to make that year\\nand the other buyers had to wait until the following Christmas for stock. The\\nnext year a much larger quantity of the toys was made up and again he sold\\nout.\\nThe mechanical or electrical toy field offers a rich market for the inventor\\nwho can capture a new idea in toys or take an old idea that has been on the\\nmarket and put it in a new dress. Every holiday, fond mothers and fathers, to\\nsay nothing of grandparents, aunts and uncles, search the toy sections for\\nsomething new and different for Jimmie or Sally Ann. Their wants are\\ninsatiable and the inventor who can satisfy those wants will profit\\nhandsomely.Funeral Flags and Insignia\\nT\\nWO years ago, Robert Hubbell was out of work. Then one day he went to a\\nfuneral with a friend. Before the procession of cars started for the cemetery,\\nthe undertaker’s assistant clamped a metal device on the running board of the\\ncar to hold a white flag with a purple cross. When the funeral was over and\\nthe clamp was removed, Robert Hubbell’s friend found the enamel scratched\\nand the metal wrinkled where the clamp had been applied.\\nRobert Hubbell gave the matter a little thought and within two hours in his\\nworkshop had invented a flag holder that slipped on over the bumpers. As\\nflags get bedraggled in the rain and snow, he decided that a paper flag would\\nbe better as it could be changed for every funeral at small expense. So, the\\nnew arrangement included a flag mast on which a paper flag could be\\nclamped.\\nThe idea was a winner and today, Mr. Hubbell has a factory where he makes\\nholders, masts, and white flags. He employs a dozen people and spends most\\nof his time out on the road selling to wholesalers. In addition, he has spent\\nsome time helping to lobby bills through a dozen states requiring the use of\\nfuneral flags in processions to prevent traffic from breaking into the line.\\nToy Automobile Puzzles Onlookers\\nA\\nLITTLE fifty-cent toy Ford automobile, which is bringing its inventor plenty\\nof profits, creates interest by its trick of automatically turning in another\\ndirection. Just as it reaches the edge of the table and you think it will run off,\\na hidden third wheel, at right angles to the front wheels, turns the automobile\\nin another direction. Everyone wants one of these toys because of its trick of\\nfooling the onlooker. Such toys offer a fertile field for inventors.ProfitsfromWhittling\\nI\\nN 1915 , A. O. Dinsdale (O’Dee to his friends) was an ambitious young man\\nwho had just been graduated from the California School of Fine Arts and the\\nBerkeley School of Arts and Crafts. He was determined to become a painter\\nequaling Michelangelo. But the war changed all that. After serving in France,\\nDinsdale returned to San Francisco restless and unsettled. He went up into the\\nhigh Sierras and isolated himself in a crude cabin twenty miles upgrade. Here\\nhe aimlessly whittled out queer little animals and painted them. A hunter\\nchancing on his retreat saw these animals and chuckled. “They’ve got\\npersonality,” he said. “Send ’em down to the art shops. They’ll sell.”\\nDinsdale followed this advice and his animals became a fad. He grew so busy\\npainting pink elephants and purple lions that he had no time to bemoan\\nshattered ambitions. Returning to town he purchased a band saw and cut his\\ncreatures out of three-ply pine, painting them in oils. Because his art\\neducation had included a thorough study of anatomy, his animals were\\nproportionately right despite their whimsicalities and gaudy hues.\\nBusiness expanded. In his garage he worked out nursery interiors and store\\ndisplays: “The Old Woman Who Lived in a Shoe,” for instance, for a juvenile\\nshoe department. Dinsdale called his workshop the O’Dee Studio and\\ndesigned a black cat and blackbird trade-mark because his recently acquired\\nwife considered black cats “good luck.”\\nYears passed. Today the O’Dee Studio is located downtown and equipped\\nwith the latest machinery. Animals have been left far behind in Dinsdale’s\\n“March of Progress.” His unusual profession takes in decorative relief maps\\nfor vast projects, mechanical displays timed to light and sound, caricatures,\\nand unusual animated exhibits.\\nStrange assignments come to Dinsdale, one of these being his group of\\nhistorical displays created for the Wells Fargo Bank Museum. True to scale\\nand history these dramatic tableaux in wood vie in interest with the valuablecollection of relics bearing on California’s frontier days. One, for example,\\nhas for its setting Sutter’s Mill, where gold was first discovered, and shows in\\nfive scenes the evolution of mining implements from crude pan and shovel to\\neffective hydraulic methods. The superbly painted scene, correct in every\\ndetail, is enlivened by quaint figures of Indians, miners, Spanish caballeros,\\nand others, each true to type and costume.\\nA clipper ship assignment was a hard nut to crack because these ships, which\\nused to carry mail round the Horn, are out of existence. Dinsdale spent days\\ntalking to old waterfront characters and nothing has been omitted either from\\nhis clipper ship education or from the finished model.\\nBut his greatest interest lies in synchronizing sound with movement in\\nmechanical displays. He built the first Christmas window of this type in San\\nFrancisco: “Three Little Pigs and the Big Bad Wolf” acted out while a\\nphonograph played the song. Delighted crowds almost blocked traffic.\\nBut this is only a crude beginning to Dinsdale who is working with a radio\\nengineer on sound controlled mechanics. Future animated displays will not be\\ntimed to phonograph records, he predicts; they will be moved by actual sound\\nvibrations.\\nA Shoe Pain-Killer Builds a New Business\\nA\\nLBERT SACHS , who had been a retail shoe merchant in Salisbury,\\nMaryland, for many years, long had an idea for another kind of business. He\\nselected the tail-end of the depression as a favorable time to launch this other\\nenterprise. His idea was for a device that would take the “pain” out of shoes.\\nMr. Sachs had been experimenting for ten years with various methods of\\nbreaking in new shoes mechanically. He had always been interested in\\nfinding out how he could give his customers more foot comfort. It seemed a\\npity to him that many people had so much trouble with new shoes.Finally, he developed a system consisting of a set of jacks in which holes had\\nbeen punched. These jacks were manipulated in the balky shoe until the area\\nof pressure was over a hole. Here the leather was hammered until a\\ndepression was created, thus removing the cause of discomfiture to the\\nwearer.\\nThese jacks were but the forerunner of Mr. Sachs’s present system. Gradually\\nhe evolved a hydraulic press, based on the original principle that he used in\\nSalisbury. A variety of brass forms is a part of the equipment. The machine\\npresses a form into that part of the shoe that is causing the pain. This is done\\nwith such great force that the source of the trouble is permanently removed.\\nMr. Sachs decided that the best way to handle his invention was to lease the\\nmachine to operators who would run the business according to the inventor’s\\nspecifications. Already there are three SHU-EEZ Comfort Shops in New\\nYork City. Though these shops are conducted by lessees, Mr. Sachs gives the\\nclosest attention to their supervision.\\nA charge of twenty-five cents is made for breaking in each of a pair of shoes.\\nSo popular is the service that dozens of customers drop in his main shop daily\\nto have their shoes made wearable with comfort. It seems that everybody has\\nshoes with pains in them. Early in 1936, a man from England dropped in to\\nhave his shoes adjusted. He returned a few months later, on another trip to\\nthis country, with an armful of shoes to be broken in by the hydraulic pain\\neliminator.\\nMr. Sachs’s novel business is still a very small enterprise. But it is making\\nmoney, and it holds a brilliant promise for the future. He is more than glad\\nthat he did not let the depression scare him from putting his idea to work.\\nColeman Made His $1,000 with Polish\\nS\\nOME years ago, George Coleman came upon a formula for making metal\\npolish. It sounded simple, so he decided to get the ingredients and mix upsome. This first polish was in liquid form, and reasonably successful, but\\nwhen he tried to sell it he discovered that it wasn’t exactly what prospects\\nrequired. Then he searched for a new formula. After a great deal of\\nexperimenting, he developed a formula of his own that was practical for use\\nas an all-purpose metal and glassware polish, and has made hundreds of\\ndollars as a result.\\n“While I found a widespread demand for a high-grade metal polish,” said\\nColeman, “I had difficulty selling enough to make a worth-while profit. I\\nknew practically nothing about selling or advertising in the beginning, and it\\ntook a little while for me to learn. For instance, the containers I used had no\\nlabels, and my product had no name. I sold a gallon jug to a large Chicago\\nhotel one day, and they asked me the name of the polish explaining it was\\nnecessary to name the brand in their records. That stumped me. ‘I haven’t\\ncalled it any special name,’ I said, ‘but, use it. If it’s good, you’ll want more.’\\nThe man laughed. ‘I’ll call it Use It, then.’ About two weeks later, I got a\\nphone call at my home for five gallons of Use It. That’s how I came to give\\nthe polish that name. When I went around, I told my prospective customers to\\nuse Use It, and sales began to increase. The polish did its work well, but there\\nwas a good deal of competition. However, as I picked up additional business\\nsteadily and was holding what I had, it wasn’t long before I was making real\\nmoney.\\n“I could have done better had I given the polish a trade name and made up a\\nweek or a ten-day supply at one time. But being cautious I made up only as\\nmuch polish daily as was needed to fill orders. Furthermore, I should have\\nhad some circulars printed but I did not think it was necessary to give\\ndirections to the purchaser. I have since found I was wrong.\\n“To sell readily, a metal polish must have certain features and these should be\\nexplained to the buyer. This explanation should be followed by instructions\\nabout applying the polish to glass and metal surfaces, and the effect\\ndemonstrated. Be sure that your formula does not contain poisonous or\\ninflammable agents. While the danger from fire is not great, big users of\\npolish will not have an inflammable or poisonous polish on the premises as\\nthey don’t want any more occupational hazards than are necessary. You canmake up just as good nonpoisonous and noninflammable polish as you can a\\ncombustible and poisonous polish and the cost is less. I would suggest to\\nanyone starting in the polish manufacturing business that he make\\ninnumerable tests of the product. Find out whether it is simple or difficult to\\napply. Make it as simple as possible to apply to secure the best results. If your\\nmetal polish is safe to handle, easy to apply, and polishes all metal surfaces\\nincluding brass, copper and chromium perfectly, you will have a wide sale\\nfor it. But it will be in greater demand if it can be used to bring sparkling\\nluster to mirrors, chinaware and porcelain.”\\nThere are a number of formulas for making a good polish, meeting the above\\nspecifications. The demand by clubs, hotels, taverns, hospitals, restaurants,\\noffice buildings, factories, garages, steamship lines, railroads and for home\\nuse is regular and steady. The polish may be made up at small expense, and\\nattractively packaged. The cost including packaging is about six cents for an\\neight-ounce size, which retails for twenty-five cents. Sold in bulk to large\\nusers, such polish may be priced at from a dollar to three dollars a gallon. For\\none who likes to make up formulas, there is no better way to get the “first\\nthousand” than through making and selling polish.\\nMrs.Royeton’sButton-EyedLambs\\nT\\nHERE lived in Oakland, California, a young widow named Charlotte\\nRoyeton, who, having four children to support, turned to a federal\\ngovernment agency and was given a job as playground instructor, providing\\nshe could entertain a lot of youngsters sufficiently to keep them coming back.\\nJust how could she fill these requirements? The children were from poor\\nfamilies, mixed races. They cared little for reading, they couldn’t play in the\\ncourt all the time, and sewing was “out.”\\nDesperately the widow scoured the five-and-ten, mentally discarding jigsaw\\npuzzles, dominoes, and dish towels for embroidering. Then she spied the\\nlittle pig outlined on cambric to be cut out and stuffed! She pounced on him\\nand took him to market—that is, she sat up nearly all night putting himtogether.\\nThe next morning, behold! Piggie had the niftiest black cutaway jacket edged\\nin yellow, a curlicue tail, and a rakish black hat slanted over one pink ear.\\nMrs. Royeton’s children voted him “a knockout” and when her charges saw\\nhim they seconded the motion and were eager to make one like him. The\\nwoman had no money but she said, “Look, children, I don’t know how we’ll\\ndo it but we’re going to make those pigs.”\\nShe purchased four yards of material and as much kapok as her thin purse\\nwould allow. She got seventeen pigs out of the goods but ran out of kapok.\\nSo she had the children bring discarded stockings which were cut up and used\\nto stuff the rest of them.\\nShe added other animals, purchasing some patterns and designing others,\\nuntil there were fifty varieties. The children, more and more delighted,\\nbrought every available scrap from home. Two Chinese girls brought two\\nuncalled-for sheets from their father’s laundry and after taking what material\\nthey needed gave the rest to the others. The old striped trousers of\\nAntoinette’s father yielded some amazing elephants, while Kitty McCarthy’s\\ngreen chinchilla reefer became woolly dogs with green bead eyes. Over two\\nhundred animals were made that summer by a class that had increased from\\nfifteen to fifty to the wonderment of the playground director.\\nBut here’s where the fairy tale comes in. The widow sat up nights designing\\nanimals for the next day’s session and that’s how the lamb came into\\nexistence. He was white muslin with black hoofs and his flat, black button\\neyes made him the most innocent looking lamb that ever followed Mary.\\nUnknown to his originator he was chosen for a National Exhibit of\\nHandicraft held in Washington, D. C., where he blinked at the toy buyer of\\nSaks and Company’s Fifth Avenue store, New York. It was love at first sight.\\nThe buyer demanded that lamb and more like him. In due course, Mrs.\\nRoyeton was flabbergasted to receive a letter asking for a dozen lambs and\\nplacing a large future order.\\nDaughter Eloise and the three boys fixed up a basement workshop for theirmother who glowingly declared: “I feel like a flower about to burst into\\nbloom.” She hopes soon to be able to stay home and look after her family\\nwhile earning a living. And even if she doesn’t sell a million lambs and make\\na million dollars there is every indication that she will make a thousand.\\nchapter sIX\\nSTARTING A ROADSIDE BUSINESS\\nI\\nF YOU lack money enough to take your goods to your market—that is, open\\na store, advertise extensively, or hire a crew to sell house to house—you must\\nbring your market to your door. That door may be just a roadside stand such\\nas you see along the highways. Along these well-traveled routes, with their\\never-increasing army of tourists, you have a great potential market. Jump in\\nyour car and run out on any highway. You won’t go but a few miles before\\nyou run across at least one roadside stand.\\nThis stand may be the usual type which sells farm products—eggs, poultry,\\nfruits, vegetables, butter, honey, etc. It may be one of the thousands of stands\\nscattered far and wide across the country’s highways which sells hamburgers,\\nhot dogs, barbecue sandwiches, citrus and other fruit drinks, pop, potato\\nchips, candied pop corn, doughnuts, or custard ice cream. Souvenir and postal\\ncard stands are so common it is hardly necessary to mention them. Then there\\nare the historical souvenirs which are sold around centers of historical\\ninterest.\\nWhich one of these many stands might make money for you depends upon\\nthe particular need in your locality, the buying habits of those who pass your\\nway, and your ability to attract customers. Know your community well for\\nmuch of your business may come from those in your neighborhood as well as\\nthe tourists who pass through your town. Key your product to your section.\\nThe tourist who passes through the little towns of Vermont most likely will\\nwant maple syrup or maple sugar candy. You might convert the natives of\\nVermont to hot tamales, or make the tourist think he wants them, but you\\nprobably would lose a lot of money before you had done so.So cater to your section of the country. In the Pacific Coast region, Atlantic\\nCoast, Gulf or Great Lakes sections, fish (fresh and smoked) are sold at\\nroadside stands. In the East, particularly in New York, you will find a number\\nof “milk stations.” The inhabitants of Texas are great consumers of ice cream\\nand any number of stands sell this hot weather confection. Mexican candy,\\nknown as pralines, is in demand around New Orleans and certain parts of\\nTexas. In certain western and southwestern sections, unusual rocks and semi-\\nprecious stones are sold. Indian handicrafts— bead work, silver and turquoise\\njewelry, and leather goods—are sold from stands in and near the Indian\\nreservations. Throughout the Southwest, practically everything to wear, use,\\nor to eat, is sold at roadside stands. Hand-wrought jewelry, pottery, beads,\\nlace, carved ornaments, needlework, handmade baskets, handwoven blankets,\\nhot tamales, and chili are a few of the many items you can buy along the\\nroadside.\\nIn addition to these sectional types of stands, roadside stands are successful\\nselling bird houses, garden ornaments, fishing bait, pets of all kinds, shells,\\ntaffy candy, honey and honey candy, pies, pecans, taffy apples, antiques,\\ntrellises and garden furniture of the rustic type, objects made of birch bark,\\ntoys carved from wood, flowers, plants and shrubs, goldfish, dolls and\\nneckties.\\nNext to getting the right product for your locality, there is nothing so\\nimportant to the success of your enterprise as advertising. This may be in the\\nform of signs placed in advantageous places on the routes to your stand, signs\\nin tourists’ camps and railroad stations. Or, a novel type of display stand may\\nbe sufficient to advertise your wares. One enterprising chap had a local\\nbuilder make a huge “hot dog” for a stand and thus advertised to all the world\\nhis specialty. In Hollywood is a large iceberg which sells ice cream and cones\\nto the youngsters. Out west there are also a number of huge “lemons” and\\n“oranges,” which serve citrus fruit drinks and sandwiches. If you want\\nsomething different you might construct an ice cream freezer similar to one\\nbuilt in Los Angeles. This enormous freezer, which can be seen for miles, has\\na real handle on it that turns by means of a motor. In the East a successful\\nrefreshment stand, selling buttermilk, butter, ice cream, malted milk,\\nsandwiches and similar products, is built in the form of a gigantic milk can.An awning extends over the counter built around the can. A stand designed to\\nresemble a huge basket of colorful vegetables would make a most novel\\nadvertisement for the sale of farm produce. While the country is dotted with\\nmany a “coffee pot,” one such refreshment stand is unusual in that it has an\\napartment above the store proper where the owner lives. A cider barrel or an\\nold mill would tell the world that you sell cider, and an igloo would advertise\\ncooling drinks and ice cream. Often these novel stands cost little more than\\nthe usual type to build and the advertising value is incalculable. Motorists\\nwill pass dozens of ordinary stands, but an unusual one is bound to command\\ntheir attention.\\nThe display stand is not the only type of roadside business that flourishes,\\nhowever. Many proprietors of golf driving ranges are making a good living\\ncatering to the inveterate golfer who is “just out for a ride” in his car. The\\n“pony ride” is just as popular today with youngsters as it was years ago, and\\nchildren will clamor for a ride whenever they see a pony. One man in\\nChicago made a good living for many years with his little string of ponies.\\nWhen he retired and sold out his concession and ponies, he cleared several\\nthousand dollars. Since archery is becoming popular again, archery practice\\nfields are springing up along the highways. Bicycle stands are common and\\nalso riding academies. A successful riding academy near Chicago was once\\nan old farm. The farmhouse has been turned into an inn and about two dozen\\nriding horses are stabled in the barns. Groups of young people come out on\\nSaturdays and Sundays for a gallop and dinner. Many students on vacations\\ncome out during the week.\\nAnother rather novel roadside enterprise was developed by a young man just\\nout of school who was finding it difficult to get a job. He bought several\\ninexpensive cameras and rented them at the entrance to a large picnic grove.\\nA deposit was required on each camera and a small fee was charged for\\nrental. He added to his profits by selling rolls of film at his little stand. A\\nsmall enterprise of this type is bound to succeed. The overhead is practically\\nnothing, and it fills a need that no one else is bothering to fill, always an\\nimportant factor in drawing customers. Candy bars, chewing gum, packaged\\nnuts and other items can be added to increase profits.Good Profits from a “Sale Barn”\\nI\\nN EVERY farming community there is an opportunity to conduct a sale barn\\nand earn regular profits the year round. If there aren’t now too many in your\\ncommunity it is worth trying. You don’t even need a barn, although you can\\nconduct the business better if you have a large lot and a building. You can, of\\ncourse, rent one for the purpose.\\nThese sales are conducted in the following fashion: The operator of a sale\\nbarn advertises that on regular dates he will conduct a sale of any and all\\nproperty brought to the barn. Usually the sales are held regularly, once a\\nweek, or twice a month. Saturday is frequently the day selected, although one\\nof the most successful operators of sales conducts his sale at a farm near\\nWashington Court House, Ohio, every Tuesday.\\nHorses, mules, pigs, cattle, sheep, vegetables, seed, shrubbery, fruit and all\\nkinds of farm equipment as well as furniture, stoves, and similar articles are\\nin demand. In fact, almost anything you can name is sold regularly at these\\nbarns. Sales are for cash and the auction plan of selling is followed.\\nAt the S. F. Snider Sale Barn, at Washington Court House, Ohio, each seller\\npays the operator of the barn a commission on all sales. The customary figure\\nbeing 3 per cent on live stock and 10 per cent on miscellaneous equipment.\\nOne of the contributors to this book attended a sale one afternoon at which a\\nwagonload of grapefruit, a disc plow, cattle and several horses were sold. A\\nsix-year-old gelding brought $215.\\nThe way to start is to select a good location. This may be a vacant lot, close\\nin to the business section, or if you think you need more room for the buyers\\nand sellers to park their cars, select a larger lot on the outskirts of town. It is\\nbetter, of course, if there are sheds, an empty barn, or some kind of shelter.\\nWhen you have selected your location, visit the farmers of the communityand explain your plan to them, telling them the date of the first sale. At first it\\nmay be necessary to persuade them to bring in things to sell. When talking\\nwith the farmers ask them if they haven’t a horse, mule, calf, cow, some extra\\nfruit or canned goods, a plow, rake, cultivator, manure spreader or something\\nof the kind they would like to sell. Nearly every farmer has some surplus of\\none kind or another.\\nIf your first sale is properly advertised and talked about you will have a big\\ncrowd. A good auctioneer can always get something for almost anything\\noffered. After the first sales results are known in the community there will be\\nlittle difficulty in getting things to sell and crowds to attend other sales.\\nIf there is a county or community fairground near your town and you can\\narrange to use the fair property for your sale, you will have an ideal place.\\nBut any location on good roads, easily accessible, will do for a start.\\nCommissions are paid the sale operator at the time of the sale. Usual rules of\\nbidding at auction sales are followed. Small advertisements in the local\\npapers, and handbills or sale bills, as they are called, will be sufficient\\nadvertising until the regular day and date of your sale becomes established\\nand known in the community.\\nA Roadside Tire Repair Business\\nI\\nT WAS a blown-out front tire, occurring while driving along route US 20\\nfrom Chicago to Michigan City, that started James Mowry in business. When\\nthe blow-out happened, Mowry did what many other motorists do. He\\nreplaced the flat with the spare, and threw the old tire in the weeds along the\\nroad. He decided to buy a used tire in Michigan City to carry as a spare on\\nthe way back. After calling upon several tire dealers in the Indiana city,\\nMowry was forced to pay $5.00 for one that wasn’t much better than the tire\\nhe threw away.\\nMowry felt he was cheated. The idea persisted in his mind on his way backhome, and he wondered how other motorists felt in similar situations. He\\nthought that a roadside tire service station offering rebuilt tires at low prices\\nwould make a lot of money. By the time he parked his car in front of his\\nhouse, Mowry decided to go into the business himself.\\nHe rented a roadside stand adjoining a three-pump gasoline station a short\\ndistance east of Gary and stocked it with fifty rebuilt tires secured from a\\nChicago jobber. He put up large signs 300 feet east and 300 feet west of his\\nnew tire station reading: “Tires $2.25 and up—300 feet,” and another large\\nsign on the service station, facing the highway reading: “Home of Jimmy’s\\nGuaranteed Tires—$2.25 and up.” Mowry opened up for business. That was\\nJuly second. Over the Fourth of July he sold out his entire stock and made a\\nprofit of $52. His initial investment was $145, including cost of the tires, rent,\\nsigns, and incidentals. The first month he operated this stand Mowry netted a\\nprofit of $203, after deducting the entire cost of his investment.\\nRebuilt tires such as Mowry handles are standard brand tires which have been\\nreconstructed by a special process at low cost. You can safely guarantee good\\nmileage to customers who buy such tires from you. It is both a pleasant and a\\nprofitable business, requires little capital and there is practically no chance\\nfor loss.\\nA Target Green for Iron Practice\\nI\\nN ESTES PARK , Colorado, a man made a “barrel” of money last summer\\nby renting a vacant lot on the main street of this bustling resort town and, on\\na sloping bank at the far end of the lot, arranging a giant putting green. The\\nbull’s eye in the green was a hole about four times the size of a hole on a golf\\ngreen. Circles on the target green were made with ridges of stone, and were\\ngraduated so that they became narrower as they approached the cup. The\\ngreen was about twelve feet in diameter, and pitched facing the driving tee at\\nan angle of about fifteen degrees. The driving tee was about fifty feet away\\nfrom the cup.\\nThe idea, of course, was to give those who thought they were good ironshots an opportunity to prove it by pitching ten balls into the cup with a\\nniblick. Each ball dropped into the cup counted one; balls that missed the cup\\nbut dropped into the second ring, counted five, and those which landed in the\\nnext ring counted ten, and so on. Par for the hole was twenty and when a\\nplayer scored par, he was entitled to shoot ten balls free. The charge for\\nshooting ten balls was ten cents. The names of those who “shot the course”\\nunder par were posted on a blackboard where they remained all day, and a\\ndaily prize was offered to the player getting the low score. Such a shooting\\ngreen can be built at a very small cost, the only equipment needed being a\\ndozen iron clubs, both mashies and niblicks, and about fifty repainted golf\\nballs. While the idea is somewhat similar to the miniature golf fad of a few\\nyears back, it has one decided advantage: It gives the player an opportunity to\\nperfect his “approach” shots, since he is playing with regulation clubs and\\nunder conditions identical to those he will experience in an actual game of\\ngolf on any club course. The owner of such a target green can figure on the\\naverage person shooting about fifty balls at a time.\\nSelling Bait at a Roadside Stand\\nB\\nROKE, lacking any income, and in poor health, Ella Gaston, a widow of\\nseventy-seven, living in Joplin, Missouri, wondered what she could do to\\nmake some money. It occurred to her that a great number of fishermen passed\\nher home along the highway leading into the Ozark fishing country. Where\\ndid all these men get their bait? There were plenty of worms in the mud flat\\nof a creek near by—perhaps she could sell them. It was worth a try anyhow.\\nA friend built a roadside stand for her and hung a sign above it which told all\\npassers-by that fishing bait could be purchased.\\nMrs. Gaston filled kettles, pails, boxes and buckets with soil and worms. The\\npassers-by did stop and buy and before long she had to hire boys to dig\\nworms for her to supply the demand. The boys are paid 10 cents a hundred\\nfor the wrigglers and she sells them for 10 cents a dozen. Some days she has\\nsold as high as 1,000 dozen. In two years, Mrs. Gaston figures she has soldover a million worms! Incidentally, in these two years, she has paid her own\\nand her dead brother’s debts. And because she has had an interesting and\\nprofitable bit of work to do, she has also regained her health.\\nMaking a “Stop and Sock It” Range Pay\\nJ\\nOHN GALWAY and Martin Sheffield, high-school graduates who couldn’t\\nfind a job, put their heads together, rented a vacant corner of two well-\\ntraveled highways on the outskirts of Chicago, and started a golfdriving range\\nthat paid them $600 in five months. It could easily be made to pay $1,000.\\n“The idea wasn’t original,” said Galway, “but it was the best we could think\\nof, and required practically no capital to start. We rented the corner for fifteen\\ndollars for the entire summer season, that being the amount of the owner’s\\ntaxes. The owner thought we were crazy, I guess, but told us to go ahead. We\\nborrowed fifty dollars from our parents, got some secondhand lumber with\\nwhich we built a stand, and had some signs painted. Then we measured off\\ndistances and put up the signs at fifty, one hundred, one hundred and fifty,\\none hundred seventy-five, two hundred, and two hundred and fifty feet from\\nthe tee-off. We leveled the tee-off ourselves, and did all our own labor,\\ncutting the grass, and fixing up things. Our expenses for lumber and the signs\\ncame to twenty-one dollars. As we had a few golf clubs, we didn’t need to\\nbuy any at the start. We bought the cheapest golf balls we could get with the\\nrest of the fifty dollars, and were ready to do business. Our prices were\\ntwenty-five cents for driving twenty-five balls; fifty cents for driving seventy-\\nfive balls. We opened up on a cold Sunday morning in late April, and with\\nhigh hopes sat in the stand. A few cars passed, but none stopped. Our first\\ncustomer appeared about one o’clock that afternoon, and invested fifty cents\\nin driving practice. The next customer pulled up while the first one was on\\nthe tee, and invested a quarter. Two more appeared, before the first two had\\nfinished, and all left about the same time. However, we pocketed two dollars,\\nand weren’t feeling very bad. Still, we were rather anxious. In the days that\\nfollowed there wasn’t much business. We heard of another practice rangeabout five miles off and I went over to see what they were doing, but they\\nweren’t doing much either. I talked to the owner. ‘Don’t worry,’ he advised,\\n‘they come in bunches. When they see one or two people practicing on your\\ncourse, a number will stop. The idea is to keep someone practicing as much\\nas possible.’\\nAttracting Customers\\n“I agreed with that, thinking of our first day’s experience. I felt the trick was\\nto get the first motorist to stop and practice. When I got back, I talked the\\nmatter over with Martin, who said: ‘Why not decoy them, like hunters decoy\\nducks? Get someone to hang around and practice when we have no\\ncustomers. Then when people are passing they might stop.’ We tried to get\\nsomeone, but everyone we invited told us we’d have to pay them a salary. As\\nwe couldn’t do that we took turns swinging at the balls ourselves. First I\\nwould swing for an hour, and then Martin would have a go at it. Whether this\\nbrought the customers or not, I can’t exactly say, but business began to pick\\nup. Women, out for a drive afternoons during the week, drove up and\\npracticed for a little while. Many came regularly every day. Meanwhile\\nMartin and I were learning things about driving, and how to take a good\\nstance and get that little extra snap in the drive that gives added power. Soon\\nwe were making fairly long drives, and began to attract attention from\\nmotorists. A golf professional, formerly with a small golf club came to see us\\none day. He told us he was out of a job, and would like to give driving\\nlessons. We arranged to let him use our place on a fifty-fifty split, and put up\\na sign. He charged two dollars an hour, and helped Martin’s form and mine,\\nwhile he was around. When he got another job, a month later, we left the sign\\nup which offered instruction and collected the two dollars hourly ourselves\\nfor teaching. Sunday is our big day. On a sunny Sunday afternoon we took in\\nas high as thirty dollars from the practice range, and from the lessons. Week\\ndays ran about eighteen dollars on an average. Of course, there was no\\nbusiness at all when it rained.”\\nA couple of hundred golf balls, a few clubs, a stand, and a good-sized lot\\nalong a highway is all the equipment needed for a driving course. Side lines\\nsuch as cold soft drinks, sandwiches, and ice cream, coffee, cigarettes and barcandies will add to the total profits. There are few more attractive ways for\\nyoung and active men to get a start and accumulate capital during the open\\nseason.\\nARoadsideBookstore\\nA\\nN UNUSUAL business has been developed by J. C. Meredith, who operates\\na roadside stand near Traverse City, Michigan. This roadside stand sells\\nneither hot dogs nor hamburgers, ice cream nor gasoline, but books. While\\nrare in this country, this type of bookshop or stall is common in Europe,\\nespecially Paris. Mr. Meredith believes that the average person likes to\\nbrowse in a bookshop and that not even a tourist can resist the impulse to stop\\nand look over books and prints. A large sign over his stand states: “Why\\nhurry? You’ll enjoy visiting this roadside bookshop.”\\nchapter seVen\\nSTOREKEEPING AS A BUSINESS\\nW\\nHEREVER you live there are plenty of ordinary stores. In most towns and\\ncities there are too many ordinary stores. Every week thousands of retail\\nstorekeepers go bankrupt, are closed out and shut up, with losses varying\\nfrom $1,000 to $10,000 each. One Los Angeles wholesale house has one man\\nwho does nothing but attend to closing up stores, the owners of which can’t\\npay their merchandise bills.\\nVarious reasons are given by the mercantile reporting agencies for the failure\\nof so many retail stores: Lack of capital, inexperience, credit losses, poor\\nmanagement, bad locations. These are but a few of the reasons given. Yet\\nwhen you come right down to the final analysis, you will find that the chief\\nreason is because the storekeeper did not render a needed or useful service to\\nthe community he served.\\nThat should be your first thought in determining whether or not you want toopen a store. Can you render a useful service to the town, community or\\nneighborhood to which you will look for your patronage? Will you offer the\\npeople of your community some service they need, or want, but are not now\\nenjoying? Or will your store merely attempt to duplicate some service which\\nis already being well performed? Will your store simply become another unit\\nin an already overcrowded field?\\nThere are in the United States, as this is being written,\\n532,010 food stores\\n56,697 drug stores\\n26,996 hardware stores\\n28,709 dry goods stores\\n18,967 shoe stores\\n9,568 millinery stores 13,198 men’s furnishing stores 32,555 meat markets\\n11,741 variety stores\\n17,043 furniture stores\\n21,975 women’s ready-to-wear 12,447 jewelry stores\\nBetween the time this is written and the time you will read it, thousands of\\nthese stores will have gone bankrupt, changed hands, merged, moved or\\nmade some other change which indicates that the owners are making little, if\\nany, profit. From this summary it may seem to you as if storekeeping is a bad\\nbusiness; but it isn’t. It is a fundamental necessity. Retail business suffers\\nless, as a whole, than any other type of business during a period of\\ndepression. Of course, a depression clears out the unfit, the lazy, the slovenly\\nand careless retailers. But the good ones carry on year in and year out, during\\ngood times and bad, with as great a degree of stability as is found in any other\\ntype of business.\\nIn spite of the dismal record of failures, you may want to open a store. What\\nkind of store? The chains have made it increasingly difficult to make a profit\\nout of a grocery, drug, cigar, hat or shoe store. There are plenty of these\\nstores, anyway, so why pick a field in which you must compete with the most\\nastute merchandisers in the country? Because of factors over which no\\nindividual has any control, discussion of the ordinary types of stores such asgrocery, cigar, drug, hat and shoe, is being omitted. Of course, independent\\nstorekeepers enter these fields every week and some of them succeed. But to\\noperate a drug store successfully you must be a pharmacist; a shoe store\\nrequires a heavy investment; there are so many incompetents in the grocery\\nfield and so much bitter competition from the chains, there isn’t much\\nincentive to enter it.\\nDespite all the adverse factors that must be taken into consideration when\\ncontemplating storekeeping as a business, it is well to remember that some of\\nAmerica’s greatest fortunes have been earned from storekeeping. There is\\nalways room for real ability. Thousands of new things to sell are being put on\\nthe market each year, each new item opening a new field for the storekeeper.\\nThink of all the electrical appliances which were unheard of ten or twenty\\nyears ago; think of how much more is spent today than ten years ago for\\nsporting goods, sports clothing and toys. Think of all the things now bought\\nready-made or ready prepared which only a few short years back were made\\nin the home. Millions of women never bake a cake today, but buy their cakes,\\ncookies and bread from stores. Think of all the things women used to make\\nfor themselves that they now buy from stores. There was a time when a\\nwoman bought a purse and used it until it was worn out. Now she buys a\\npurse, a hat, gloves, stockings, and shoes to match every dress. The matched\\naccessories or ensemble idea has added millions of dollars to retail sales in\\nrecent years.\\nIt is easy to see there is no limit to the variety of services a retailer can render.\\nA far larger share of our national income is spent today in retail stores than in\\nthe days when our own hands made most of what we eat, use and wear. This\\nis one of the reasons storekeeping is growing and will continue to grow and\\nexpand.\\nDeciding What Kind of Store to Open\\nHaving eliminated fields which are overcrowded and fields where special\\nexperience or training is a necessity, it is evident that you may not want to\\ntackle any of the usual types of stores. But even with all these eliminations\\nthere still remains a vast field for the owner of a specialty store. What ismeant by the term “specialty” store? In the usual sense of the word it means\\nthe little shops that dot every Main Street—the shops that specialize in\\nlingerie, corsets, costume jewelry, $1.88 hats for women, novelty shops, etc.\\nBut there are hundreds of other specialty shops which have not yet penetrated\\nall parts of the country.\\nSome of these are: Tropical fish shops, pet shops, exclusive hosiery shops,\\nlittle shops that sell nothing but nuts and nut candies, bridge shops that\\nspecialize in bridge supplies and prizes, necktie shops, fountain pen shops,\\nvacuum cleaner stores, washing machine (new and used) shops, portable\\ntypewriter shops, drugless drug stores, gift shops, butter-and-egg stores, milk\\ndepots, stamp shops or exchanges, potato chip stores, pop corn candy stores,\\ngreeting card and novelty shops and a score of other unusual stores.\\nYour previous experience, your likes and dislikes, your personal preferences,\\nall should be taken into consideration when thinking of opening a specialty\\nshop. Then there is the matter of finances. How much can you invest? How\\nbig a business do you want? Do you want to go into business on a fairly\\npretentious scale, selling on credit, delivering and handling a large stock? Or\\ndo you prefer a small shop which you can run with the aid of one assistant,\\nwith no delivery or credit expense? Take all of these factors into careful\\nconsideration before you decide what kind of store to open.\\nThere is another factor too. What kind of people do you know? Do you have\\na following and acquaintance among factory workers? Then pick a store with\\nmerchandise they can buy. Or do you know the community’s wealthiest and\\nmost stylish folks? If this is true start a store catering to them. Make use of\\nevery advantage you possess. Do you know automobile owners, or have you\\nserved them in some capacity in the past? Then perhaps you will want to\\nconsider a tire store. Whatever your past experience may have been, you\\nshould try to capitalize on it when you open your store.\\nThere is another way to determine what kind of store to open. Find out what\\nthe people of your community must go out of town to buy. Suppose you were\\nthinking of starting a fishing tackle store. Contact a number of fishermen and\\nget them to tell you where they buy tackle. Do they have to go to some out-of-town store, or buy by mail? Would they patronize you if you handled a\\ncomplete line? What items do they have the most difficulty in finding in local\\nstores? These are some of the questions to ask around your community before\\nyou start a store.\\nIn this book you will find specific and definite suggestions, based on the\\nactual experience of others in starting specialty stores. From these\\nsuggestions, and a careful survey of the needs of your community, there is no\\nreason why, if you really want to, you can’t start a successful store.\\nChoosing the Best Location\\nThere are two general types of store locations, popularly called “high rent\\nlocations” and “low rent locations.” Of course, the high rent locations are the\\n“hot spots” on the busiest downtown streets. Even a small store in such a\\nlocation may rent for thousands of dollars a year. Without adequate capital\\nsuch locations are almost out of the reach of the average beginner in\\nstorekeeping. But for the sale of certain “drop in” items these locations are\\nalmost essential.\\nPeople will not walk upstairs, around the block, or even across the street to\\nbuy convenience items such as chewing gum, cigars, cigarettes, popular drug\\nitems, soft drinks and similar merchandise. For stores specializing in this type\\nof merchandise, location is the most important thing.\\nIn selecting your location try to determine how much your type of store is\\nactually dependent on location. Pick a location that is in a growing section of\\ntown. Beware of a section that is being overrun by manufacturing, garages,\\ncheap rooming houses, or gives other indications that the neighborhood is\\ngoing to seed.\\nDifferent types of stores require different locations. Be sure you know just\\nwhat type of people you intend to cater to, and that the location you select is\\nin a neighborhood frequented by such people. In every business section there\\nis always one side of the street that is most popular; locate your store on this\\nside of the street. Most of the busiest locations are now cluttered up with\\ncheap chain stores, featuring “price” merchandise. A high-grade storesandwiched in between a $1.88 hat store and a “five-anddime” store might\\nfail, in spite of the heavy traffic passing it.\\nDon’t be too sure that your store will attract people a block or so out of their\\nhabitual path. People have gone broke trying to change buying habits. Don’t\\nhamper your store by selecting a location where people have to walk up\\nsteps, or take a few steps down to a floor level, even a foot or so below the\\nsidewalk level. Obtain a location with floor exactly level with the sidewalk.\\nBeware of a store with a front that curves inward—people don’t notice such a\\nfront.\\nMost young business men make the mistake of leasing a store that is really\\ntoo big. Figuring out how much you think you want, then cutting the space in\\nhalf, isn’t a bad rule to follow when selecting a location. Remember that a\\nlarge store requires more heat and light, more fixtures, and a bigger stock.\\nJust because a landlord wants to sell you the entire store is no sign he will not\\ndivide the store and rent you half or two-thirds of it.\\nIt may even be possible to lease space from a noncompeting store. Jewelers\\noccasionally lease a space in one end of a drug store. Sometimes you will see\\na jewelry store in one section of a furniture store. Many expenses can be\\nreduced or eliminated if you can start your store as part of another store\\nwhich is already well established. In hundreds of department stores\\nthroughout the country there are independent operators who own certain\\ndepartments, but operate them as a part of the big store.\\nLobbies of office buildings, hotel lobbies, or even a small space in what\\nwould be one entrance to a large store are frequently used for small stores.\\nRemember that every cent you save on rent and other expenses will enable\\nyou to hold out successfully just that much longer.\\nWhat Makes a Store Successful\\nSidney Carter, of the Merchant’s Service Department of Rice-Stix, the big St.\\nLouis wholesale house, has made a special study for many years of the\\nfactors that make a store successful. He puts it this way: “I know a merchant\\nwho isn’t very friendly, whose store isn’t very neat, but who does a bigbusiness because he has merchandise in good quantities. I know another\\nmerchant whose store is neat, whose stocks are good, but who does a\\ncomparatively poor business, because he isn’t friendly with people. I know\\nanother merchant who has a badly lighted store, and no fixtures to brag about,\\nbut who does a big business because he is a good salesman and knows how to\\nteach his clerks to sell. So you see there are always many factors in\\ndetermining what makes a store successful.”\\nThe National Cash Register Company, whose officials know as much as\\nalmost any group of men on earth about operating stores, reports in its\\nexcellent book, Better Retailing, that the things which customers like are:\\nA good assortment of well-arranged stock.\\nPrices right and in plain sight.\\nQuick, courteous, accurate service.\\nExchange and money back without question.\\nTruthfulness about merchandise.\\nThe same price to everybody.\\nAn attractive, convenient, well-lighted, comfortable store. Chairs for rest\\nwhen selecting goods that take time. Careful attention to children and\\nservants.\\nAccurate filling of telephone orders.\\nThere has been an enormous improvement in stores in the past few years.\\nCustomers are accustomed to better salespeople, more careful attention, an\\nincreasing amount of “service,” better lighting, and far more courtesy than we\\nonce expected. They simply will not tolerate a slipshod, careless, unkept store\\nany more. A store that isn’t neat has no more chance than a frowsy debutante.\\nPeople will no longer argue about returned goods. No matter how “wrong”\\nthe customer may be, he is right in his own mind and expects to be treated\\naccordingly. A customer may have no right to expect to return a hat after she\\nhas worn it, but no merchant ever got rich standing up for his “rights.”\\nOverbuying is another cause for many failures. A successful, old-time\\nmerchant’s secret of making a profit was simply: “Remember you can alwaysbuy more.” In buying your opening stock keep in mind that the manufacturers\\nare scarcely going to stop making merchandise that is in demand. In opening\\nyour store don’t tie up more than half of your capital stock. Save some of it\\nfor unexpected expenses, for tiding you over a dull season, or for stock to\\nreplace slow selling merchandise mistakenly purchased when opening.\\nKeep Merchandise Moving\\nSuccessful merchants aren’t afraid to sacrifice merchandise that is not\\nmoving. After you have kept merchandise more than a few weeks it has\\nbegun to “eat its head off.” It should be sacrificed at any reasonable price just\\nto get your money out of it, so you can put money into something that will\\nturn and make profits. No matter how much merchandise costs, it is worth\\nonly what you can get for it.\\nSuccessful merchants have always gone slowly in committing themselves for\\nheavy time-payments on costly equipment. Don’t make the same mistake one\\nmerchant did who had an $800 stock of variety goods and a $750 cash\\nregister! While good equipment is essential, don’t tie yourself up for\\npayments on fixtures, scales, registers and signs. Even if you do a good\\nbusiness monthly installments on equipment will take all the ready cash you\\ncan obtain.\\nLast, but not least, move heaven and earth to satisfy your customers, and\\nkeep them coming back. If a customer buys only once, telephone him, see\\nhim, write him a letter, if you even suspect that he is buying elsewhere. Find\\nout why he didn’t repeat. Make any errors right. Make him understand that\\nyou are striving to please him. It is by such tactics that successful\\nstorekeepers are made.\\nStarting a Stamp Shop\\nT\\nHE intense interest which has developed in stamp collecting led Phillip\\nCarpenter, retired from the postal service at the age of sixtyfive, to sell thestamps he had collected to philatelists in Portland, Oregon, where he lives.\\nAlthough he had a limited supply of stamps at the start, he rented a portion of\\na store window, placed most of his stock on display, and waited for buyers to\\ncome along.\\n“My time was worth practically nothing,” he explained, “so there was little to\\nbe lost by displaying the stamps and talking to possible buyers. I had quite a\\nnumber of stamps which I had bought from the post office during the thirty\\nyears I carried mail. Other stamps had been given to me by relatives and\\nfriends who had heard that I was collecting stamps. Many of these were\\nduplicate commemoration stamps, such as the Century of Progress and\\nHarding; a number were foreign and air mail. All in all, they made a good\\ndisplay.\\n“However, as I had little merchandising sense, I made only $15 the first\\nweek, which was barely enough to cover expenses. After a few weeks, I got\\nacquainted with other dealers. We met once a week in a little restaurant and\\ntalked business. From then on I began to get the right slant on the stamp\\nbusiness. They explained that the prices I was charging for some issues were\\ntoo low; other prices were too high. They also pointed out that I needed some\\nnew stock so I got in touch with several wholesalers. I learned values quickly\\nafter that and shortly I saw the real possibilities of this business.\\n“I studied various stamp issues and found that I could buy from private\\ncollectors at more advantageous prices than I could from the wholesalers.\\nOne day a chap came in with a marvelous collection. ‘I’m broke,’ he said,\\n‘I’ll sell you this entire stock for $100.’ He told me that these stamps had\\noriginally cost him almost $2,000. The other collectors, because of the\\ndepression and because he insisted on selling them the whole lot intact, had\\nturned him down. When I glanced over the stamps, I discovered several that\\nwere rare, and I saw that I could easily make a good profit. So I took the lot.\\nThe next day, I called upon a customer who had been seeking some Danish\\nWest Indies, and sold him three blocks of four each at a good profit. Before\\nthat week was over, I had sold the entire collection to history professors,\\nschool teachers, and stamp collectors for $796. For sometime I thought about\\nthis sale and I came to the conclusion that if one person had a collection tosell, there probably were others. I ran a small advertisement in the newspaper\\noffering to buy all or part of the stamp collections of the people in Portland. I\\nsecured several good collections in this way and presently I had a good-sized\\nstock at a cost of only $460. I discontinued the advertisement and began to\\nconcentrate on selling this stock. Before long I had sold all but a few of the\\nstamps at a profit of $1,400.”\\nCarpenter contacts the universities, schools and even the museum in Portland.\\nSchool teachers, especially those teaching high-school classes, are interested\\nin stamps, since they are able to teach more colorfully such subjects as\\nhistory and geography through their use. Foreign canceled stamps, especially\\nthose from France, India, England, Italy, Germany, Sweden, British South\\nAfrica, Honduras, China, and Japan, are, regardless of issue, in constant\\ndemand by school teachers. They bring as high as 300 to 400 per cent profit\\nto the stamp collector.\\nCatalogs listing the prices at which stamps should be sold are available from\\nwholesalers and some of the stamp listings give both wholesale and retail\\nprices. A stamp shop may be started either by advertising in the newspapers\\nfor stamps, as Carpenter did, or by getting in touch with one of the many\\nwholesale stamp companies. These companies will generally submit a large\\nassortment of stamps on an approval basis, allowing the dealer a discount of\\n25 to 50 per cent. Hence he can start his shop with very little capital. An\\nexcellent location for this type of business is in a circulating library near a\\nschool.\\nMaking a Grocery Store Pay\\nI\\nT IS a notorious fact that most people who open up a grocery store fail. The\\nmortality rate is higher than in almost any other business. There are a number\\nof reasons why this is true. Sometimes the man who opens up the store lacks\\nindustry. He is just plain lazy. He may have picked a poor location. Or he\\nmay have shown poor judgment in stocking his store. But the principal reason\\nfor the high percentage of failures is that the average man who opens agrocery store overlooks the importance of sales ability and sales knowledge.\\nCompetition in the grocery business is so keen today that old methods of\\nstorekeeping won’t do. In order to succeed you have to know why people\\nbuy, and how to make them buy. To some extent this knowledge comes\\nnatural to observant people. However, there are certain definite fundamentals\\nabout salesmanship which need to be understood to be successful in the retail\\nbusiness. Fortunately for James Brandt, he realized this when he began to\\nthink about opening a grocery store in Los Angeles. He could not very well\\ngive up two or three years to acquire the needed selling experience, but he\\nlearned from a friend that there were schools which taught the principles of\\nsalesmanship by mail. That, he thought, would make it easy since he could\\nopen his store and study while he earned. “One section of this course,” he\\nsaid, “was devoted to retail merchandising and, among other things,\\nexplained various methods of building retail sales. This section, of course,\\nwas intended for the wholesaler’s salesman making calls upon retailers, and\\nwas designed to show him how to help the retailer move the goods from his\\nshelves. Being a retailer, I read this section carefully and found a number of\\nexcellent suggestions which I later put into practice in my grocery business.\\n“From the day I opened the store, I realized the benefits of my salesmanship\\ncourse. Not only did it teach me how to address a customer, but it taught me\\nhow to suggest things so as to build up the unit of sale. By applying the right\\nmerchandising principles, I found I could increase a sale by as much as a\\ndollar. You see there’s a difference in the way an additional item is suggested\\nto a customer. Suggest it one way and the customer resents it. Suggest it\\nanother, and the customer is interested. This art of suggestion helped me get a\\ngood start. By applying this principle and others, I soon built up a successful\\ntrade here in Los Angeles.”\\nJimmy Brandt’s course in salesmanship cost him eighty-four dollars, which\\nhe paid in small monthly payments. But it was worth considerably more than\\nthat to him. While most people may not be interested in a course in\\nsalesmanship, it is well to think of the many advantages of training if you\\nwant to succeed in business. Undoubtedly, such training does open new\\nfields, and keeps you from making mistakes that often are costly and alwaysavoidable. No better way of preparing yourself for a successful career in\\nbusiness may be found than is furnished by specialized training in business\\npractice and business fundamentals. It certainly shortens the way to that “first\\nthousand.”\\nThe “Ins and Outs” of Running a Gift Shop\\nM\\nRS. BARCLAY had $500. She wanted to start a business of her own. There\\nwere already two struggling gift shops in the town, but they carried mediocre\\nmerchandise. Any gift the least out of the ordinary had to be purchased from\\nthe department stores in the near-by city. Practically everyone played bridge\\nthe year round in this town and there was an active social life—plenty of\\n“showers” for brides-to-be, baby “showers,” announcement parties,\\nchildren’s birthday parties, etc. Here was a madeto-order market for gift\\nmerchandise. “What this town needs is a good gift shop and I am going to see\\nthat it has one,” Mrs. Barclay remarked to an old friend one day.\\nThe first step was to find the proper location. A vacant store, near enough to\\nthe business center to attract trade and not too near that the rent would be out\\nof line, proved to be an ideal location. The interior was painted a pale yellow,\\nand the inexpensive shelves and display tables made by a local carpenter\\nwere painted the same color. Sheer yellow curtains at the two display\\nwindows were drawn to the sides in order to permit the passer-by a clear\\nview of the interior. This one-color scheme made an effective background for\\nthe display of merchandise which naturally comes in every color of the\\nrainbow.\\nOne wall of shelves held china, pottery and glassware. The wall across from\\nit held brass, pewter, woodenware and silver gifts. The display shelves on the\\nback wall were low and above them was hung a lovely piece of chintz and a\\ncolonial mirror. These low shelves held toys suitable for children from\\ninfancy up to the age of ten or so. The space above the shelves on the other\\ntwo walls was large enough to permit the hanging of several pictures—\\netchings, prints, reproductions of oils and water colors. Two comfortablechairs with end tables at their sides, three display tables and the wrapping\\ncounter took up the remainder of the space but left sufficient room for a small\\ncrowd to get about.\\nOne of the tables was sufficiently long to display a number of items suitable\\nfor bridge prizes from $1.00 to $3.00, the prices usually paid in this\\ncommunity for bridge prizes. A smaller table displayed playing cards, bridge\\ntallies, pencils, table covers, ash trays, and a few books on systems of playing\\nbridge. The third table held novelties which were the fad at the moment and\\nfor which there would be a certain demand for a short time. The display case,\\nwhich was the bottom of the wrapping counter, held merchandise which is\\neasily soiled. This merchandise included silk lamp shades, silk and velvet\\ncushions, dainty linens and baby gifts such as bonnets, jackets, dresses,\\nshoes, carriage robes, and pillows.\\nA cabinet at one end of the counter contained gift cards, fancy paper for\\nwrapping gifts, ribbon and colored string, little candles for birthday cakes,\\nlarger candles in various colors for luncheon and dinner tables, paper napkins\\nand tablecloths, and place cards.\\nThe windows were kept shining and bright and the displays changed daily.\\nOnly a few things were placed in each window each day—perhaps a bowl\\nand candlesticks, a picture and a piece of beautiful brocade, or a small lamp\\nand and unusual cigarette box opened to show the cigarettes within. Each\\npiece displayed was beautiful, distinctive, colorful, or perhaps all three.\\nBuilding Up a Clientele\\nA customer list maintained on cards gives the name of the customer, address,\\nand telephone number and, on the back, a list of the things purchased with the\\ndate of purchase. A check of these cards from month to month brings up the\\nnames that are not buying and a simple announcement describing new\\nmerchandise received is mailed to such names. The telephone is also used to\\ntell customers about new items. Subscriptions to gift magazines keep Mrs.\\nBarclay in touch with new merchandise, and a visit to the more important gift\\nshops and the department store gift sections in the large city near by alsogives her new ideas on displays and gift items. Then there is, of course, the\\nsemi-annual exhibit of giftwares in the city, which she attends regularly.\\nMagazines such as House Beautiful, Harper’s Bazaar, Vogue are looked over\\ncarefully for suggestions which may be incorporated in displays or window\\narrangements. When talking to customers she makes a point of mentioning\\nsuch and such an item or display as being similar to that shown in the current\\nissue of House Beautiful or Vogue, or other magazine from which it happens\\nto have been culled. This plan always succeeds in creating interest in a new\\ndisplay and at the same time helps to sell the customer.\\nAfter the first few weeks people began to take notice of this shop. They found\\nthat it wasn’t just a place where you might find what you wanted; it was a\\nshop that would have just what you wanted. This ability to create confidence\\nin her selection of merchandise began to build up a nice clientele almost\\nimmediately. By the end of the first year, Mrs. Barclay had to hire an\\nassistant and to add two new sections to her shop—a greeting card section\\nand a “knitting corner.” The assistant was an expert with the knitting needles\\nand being also a young woman with ideas and a pleasing personality, she\\nsoon helped Mrs. Barclay build up a nice yarn business in the “knitting\\ncorner.”\\nIt is possible, of course, to start a gift shop with less money than Mrs. Barclay\\ninvested. If your home is one of the old-fashioned, comfortable residences\\nbuilt in the nineties, part of the space can be used for your shop. The room\\nselected should be easily accessible to the passer-by and have suitable\\nwindows for display. The walls and woodwork should be painted a\\nharmonious color if they are not appropriate in their present condition for the\\ndisplay of merchandise. If the room has a fireplace, so much the better. While\\nsome shelving will be necessary for the display of merchandise, particularly\\nas the amount of stock is increased, many of the gifts can be displayed as part\\nof the furnishings of the room. The mantel offers a suggestion for the display\\nof vases, china figurines, pictures, mirrors, etc., and the display should be\\nchanged daily in order to make the most of this central feature. One or two\\ngate-leg tables, a Pembroke table, a tilt-top, and a coffee table will aid in the\\ndisplay of gifts and a chest of drawers will hold much of the more fragile\\nmerchandise. A study of the types of interiors featured in the currentmagazines devoted to interior decoration will help you in the arrangement of\\nthis type of room.\\nAn announcement in the local paper and printed announcements, suggesting\\nappropriate gifts for all occasions, mailed to a selected list of names, will let\\npeople know that you have a shop and that it is open for business. Keep a list\\nof your customers and the “lookers” as well, and use the telephone to keep in\\ntouch with them when new merchandise arrives. Don’t expect this type of\\nbusiness to grow overnight—rather a slow, steady rate of growth should be\\nyour aim.\\nHow to Become a Corsetiere\\nI\\nF THERE is a hospital in your town here is an idea that may be worth\\n$1,000 to you. A woman who had been a corsetiere decided to open a shop\\nwith her savings. She selected a location in a busy outlying part of the city in\\nwhich she lived. Two blocks away, the neighborhood was zoned for light\\nfactories and, of course, many girls were employed in the offices of these\\nfactories. There were also a number of young women employed in the offices\\nand stores in the immediate neighborhood. But most important of all, just two\\nblocks from her store was a large hospital. Having had considerable\\nexperience in fitting surgical corsets, she had selected this location in order to\\nbuild up a business catering to post-operative cases in need of abdominal\\nsupport, and in supplying the proper type of corsets for invalids and others in\\nneed of special corrective garments.\\nShe arranged to carry the “line” of a well-known manufacturer of popular\\ntypes of corsets, brassieres and girdles. This company was also noted for its\\nsurgical supports and offered excellent cooperation to corsetieres handling\\nthis sort of garment. Keeping in mind her market, she stocked her shop with\\ngirdles for the younger women who worked in the offices in the\\nneighborhood, with corsets for the heavy matronly figures among the\\nhousewives in the residential section, with collar and cuff sets, belts, gloves,\\nhandkerchiefs, a good grade of hosiery, brassieres and other lingerie,boutonnieres, and notions such as darning cotton, tape, thread, hairpins,\\npowder puffs, etc. Later when she began to know her customers’ tastes better\\nshe would purchase ten to fifteen dresses in the moderatelypriced line which\\nshe knew would be suitable for certain customers, and telephone them that\\nthe dresses were in stock. Frequently, all were sold in a day or two as the\\nstyles and prices were right.\\nHer first step in building up a business in corrective garments was to call on\\nthe doctors in the neighborhood and explain that she was a trained corsetiere\\nand specialized in surgical supports. She also left cards with the hospital\\noffice. Through the nurses who purchased hosiery and other items, she\\nsecured further advertising.\\nA card record of every customer was kept on file giving the name, address,\\ntype of garment purchased, date purchased, and size. From time to time post\\ncards were sent to these names announcing something special. A separate\\nrecord was kept of the patients who had been fitted with surgical supports,\\nand these names were followed up by special calls in order to determine\\ndefinitely whether or not the garment sold had been satisfactory and,\\nincidentally, whether a new one or a different type of garment was now\\nrequired.\\nThe store had only one display window but she made the most of it by\\nkeeping it spotlessly clean, by changing the displays frequently, and by\\ndisplaying the latest fashions in lingerie or the most attractive seasonal items.\\nWhenever she had purchased a few dresses she would place one in the\\nwindow with a card stating that a new stock of dresses had just arrived.\\nWithin the store, the collars and cuffs, the handkerchiefs and silken lingerie\\nwere attractively arranged in display cases, brassieres were displayed on\\nmodels in the corset section, and if dresses were in stock they were arranged\\non a long rack at the back of the shop. The surgical support section was\\nlocated in a room at the back of the shop which was divided to include a\\nfitting room and space for altering garments.\\nFor ten years this little shop flourished and during good times and bad she\\nmade money. What competition did spring up quickly died down because shenever made any attempt to compete on a price basis and very few merchants\\ncould match her ability to serve customers. The corset manufacturer whose\\nline she carried saw that she had about exhausted her market and for some\\ntime had been urging her to move to a neighborhood with greater\\npossibilities. Finally she decided to make the change and rented the shop the\\nmanufacturer’s agent had selected. Two display windows enabled her to\\nattract more passers-by and a larger stock with greater variety helped to build\\nup more business than she could have handled in the old shop. Two hospitals\\nin this neighborhood kept her busy with special fittings, and she still had\\nmany customers through the doctors at the hospital in the old neighborhood.\\nAs she located only about two miles away from the neighborhood where her\\nother shop was established, many of those whose names were on her\\ncustomer list still patronize her shop.\\nEven though you may not have the advantage of the special training which\\nthis woman had, that need not prevent you from starting a business of this\\nsort. Most of the corset manufacturers conduct courses which you can attend\\nto learn the business. You do not have to open a store at first but can start by\\nsoliciting orders from friends and others until you get a trade built up. Very\\nlittle capital is required if you begin in that way, and then after you have\\nearned a few hundred dollars you can invest in a stock and open up a store. If\\nyou like people, enjoy selling, and buy cautiously, you should soon be able to\\nbuild up a business which will net you a good income—well over $1,000 a\\nyear.\\nStart a Second-Hand Magazine Shop\\n“\\nW\\nE STARTED our magazine shop with a pile of magazines, a few dollars, an\\nidea and a location,” said Mrs. McIntyre, commenting upon the beginning of\\nthe business in which she and her husband made their first thousand dollars.\\n“We had to live somewhere, so we rented cheap store space, moved in,\\nwashed the windows and partitioned off living quarters in the rear. Then webought a pile of second-hand magazines from a storage warehouse which was\\nselling out the stored possessions of people who had not paid their storage\\nrental.”\\nAfter starting this type of store, the next move of the McIntyres was to decide\\non where they were going with it. While the sale of used magazines might\\ntide them over the depression, to make a big business of it and to build for\\npermanence and the future required a definite objective. They considered\\nways and means and finally they decided just to be “different.” They would\\ncarry a file of back numbers as far back as they could, build up this file as a\\nreference file, and at the same time build up a wholesale business in used\\nmagazines. Of course, they didn’t accomplish this aim overnight. Like so\\nmany beginners, they made many mistakes and, too, they had a great deal to\\nlearn.\\nWatching Out for Profits\\n“The most important thing I discovered,” continued Mrs. McIntyre, “is that\\neverything you sell must be sold at a profit. As long as you make a little\\nprofit on every sale, you can’t lose anything. In acquiring the used\\nmagazines, we accidentally got hold of books, sheet music, and unframed\\npictures and sketches. We did not want these things, but they were often\\nforced upon us. When we had a number of old books and pictures, we sorted\\nthem and placed price tags on them. People entering the store for magazines,\\noften bought a book or two, or inquired about books. We also found that the\\nold sheet music had a cash value. So we decided while building a file of back\\nnumbers of magazines for reference, to build a back number file of songs.\\nThis requires patience and everlasting work, but it is worth the effort, for\\nsoon you build up a reputation for your shop. We came to be depended upon\\nto deliver back numbers of many magazines, and we received orders from\\nbookstores, libraries and collectors for back issues, as well as complete files\\nof magazines. The price ranges from a nickel to two dollars and a half for\\neach magazine.\\n“We obtain the magazines from the janitors of apartment buildings, hotels,\\nand rooming houses. We also make frequent trips to the furniture storagecompanies and pick up magazines at little cost—usually about a cent a copy.\\nSome magazines may run a little higher but the most we ever figure on\\npaying for a magazine is twenty-five cents.\\n“We aim to have as complete a file on each magazine as it is possible to get.\\nWe also try to carry as many different magazines as our storage space permits\\nand we are able to secure. If a call comes in for a certain magazine title or a\\ncertain issue, we make every effort to secure it for the customer. For this\\nservice a slight extra charge is made which the customer is usually willing to\\npay if he wants the magazine.\\n“It took a little time to learn how to estimate values. I’ve sold books for a\\nnickel that I later discovered were worth several dollars, and magazines for\\nten cents that had a current value of two dollars. But each time I made a\\nmistake of this kind, I remembered it. In the beginning, it’s best to stick to the\\nmedium-priced magazines and books, until you learn more about the valuable\\nones.”\\nIn less than six months, it was necessary to expand the size of the shop so\\nmore space was rented to care for extra business. Later, this store covered a\\nwhole block and eventually a branch store was opened to care for the extra\\nbusiness.\\nQuality Sells—Even Hamburgers\\nT\\nHIS story of a successful enterprise starts out with a creaky old jallopy and\\neleven cents. Ted Lansmann, a young Californian, owned both the\\nautomobile and the grand capital of eleven cents. On his way to give the old\\nauto wreck to a friend because he could no longer afford to run it, he came\\nacross a hamburger stand on the route between Los Angeles and Pasadena.\\nThe owner of the stand had given up hope of making anything of the business\\nand he was about to close up when the jallopy and its occupant came along.\\nAfter some conversation, the owner offered the stand in exchange for the autoand the offer was accepted. When he took over, the new owner found himself\\nwith eleven cents in cash, a couple dozen buns, three cases of pop and, of\\ncourse, the shack.\\nTed knew that 11 cents wouldn’t go very far so he succeeded in borrowing\\n$50 from a friend. Then he began to think about how he could put this new\\nenterprise over. In this particular locality hamburgers were 10 cents at the\\nmajority of stands; some even charged only 5 cents. Ted decided to go whole\\nhog and put his price up to 15 cents. The hamburgers were worth it; only the\\nbest ground beef and the best buns he could buy were used. He found he had\\nno difficulty in getting 15 cents but it took him six months before he was\\ndoing much more than making expenses. The upturn came when a customer\\nasked for a hamburger with a thin slice of cheese added. Ted tried one\\nhimself and from then on specialized in cheese-burgers. The business began\\nto grow. He soon started another place in Los Angeles, then a third place was\\nopened and finally a steak house where he served the best steaks that money\\ncould buy.\\nIn 1937, business increased 500 per cent and in 1938, just eleven years after\\nhe traded in the old jallopy for the stand, Ted sold out his famous steak\\nrestaurant and property to another restaurant man for $150,000.\\nThere are thousands and thousands of hamburger and hot dog stands\\nthroughout this country, but on your travels how often do you come across\\none that can serve you a really good sandwich and a good cup of coffee?\\nQuality brings customers to the little wayside stand just as it brings them to\\nthe big department store in the center of a metropolis. Quality is what Ted\\nsold; the returns speak for themselves.\\nButter-and-Egg Stores Can Be EasilyStarted\\nB\\nECAUSE Harvey Keller didn’t want to give up his “girl friend,” he moved to\\nthe big city to be near her, and there established a business selling eggs and\\nchickens fresh from his father’s farm, which netted him a profit of over $600\\nin less than four months.Keller first brought two cases of eggs into Chicago. He called from door to\\ndoor, selling butter and eggs at a fraction under store prices and guaranteed\\nthem to be right from the farm. When these two cases of eggs were sold,\\nKeller drove back to his father’s farm and returned with seven cases. His\\nprofit on each case was four dollars. Noticing that aside from groceries and\\nmarkets, there was no place where one could secure eggs, and considering the\\nfriendly way in which the public received him, Harvey decided to open what\\nhe calls a “hennery.” He rented a small store on a side street a few doors from\\na street car line for fifteen dollars a month, and stocked this with eggs and\\nseveral crates of live chickens.\\n“I didn’t have opening a store in mind at first. I saw there was money\\nbringing in cases of fresh eggs, but it was apparent that I was wasting a lot of\\ntime driving to the farm and back. I arranged to bring in a truck load of eggs\\nand needed a place to stock them. I had my father send the chickens, hoping\\nto find a market for them. People passing the store stopped and watched me\\nstack the crates of eggs in the store. Some came inside and asked if I was\\nopening an egg store. I replied that I just brought the eggs from the farm, and\\nwould sell them at regular store prices. In a little while, I had sold fifteen\\ndozen, and was convinced a store selling eggs and chickens exclusively\\nwould pay in that locality. I locked up and made my rounds of the\\nneighborhood and when I asked for orders, told my customers about the line.\\nI sold a case of eggs and three chickens before noon, and returning to the\\nstore, fixed the door so it would remain open. That afternoon, I put in a\\ncounter. But business didn’t rush in as I expected.\\nAdvertising Brings in Customers\\n“The corner druggist told me, when I dropped into his store for cigarettes,\\nthat if he were in my place he would have some circulars printed, explaining\\nthat I had opened the store and offered chickens and selected fresh eggs\\nbrought in by truck from my father’s farm, and to distribute these circulars\\nwherever I went. This sounded like a good idea. ‘Don’t put these in the mail\\nboxes,’ the printer warned me when I picked up the circulars. ‘Hand one to\\nthe woman when she opens the door.’ Most women I called upon didn’t buy\\nfrom me, you know, for only one in a dozen needed eggs at the moment Iknocked on the door. But I left a circular at each home I called upon. Within\\na few days, I was doing a brisk business. Some people came out of curiosity,\\nbut everyone bought something. I also got considerable business by paying\\nhigh-school boys a small commission to get orders from their friends.”\\nKeller supplies country fresh eggs from this store to people from many\\nblocks around. His total investment in the store and his first stock was less\\nthan seventy-five dollars. His sales now average four cases of eggs daily, and\\ndaily earnings from the sale of both eggs and chickens run about nineteen\\ndollars. In order to handle deliveries on orders phoned in, Keller found it\\nnecessary to hire a clerk. He continues to go out from house to house picking\\nup orders, which he declares is the backbone of his business.\\nA somewhat similar idea has been developed by a family in Glencoe, Illinois,\\nwho owned a big farm near Lake Geneva. In order to market the farm’s\\nproducts and compete with local stores in North Shore towns, they rented and\\nfixed up two barns at locations near the main highways on the edge of town.\\nThe stores were advertised as “The Barn” and catered especially to\\nautomobile trade. “The Barn,” as in the case of Harvey Keller’s “Hennery,”\\ndepended upon established trade, the telephone being used to keep in touch\\nwith customers. The pleasing thing about a business of this sort is the quick\\nturnover. There is no stock to go dead on your shelves. Even though you may\\nnot own a farm, or have any relative who can supply you with fresh farm\\nproducts, you can locate some farmer who will be glad to arrange with you to\\nmarket his butter, eggs and chickens in this way. By specializing on those\\nthree products—possibly adding ducks and turkeys in season—you can build\\nup a tidy business in short order. People are willing to pay well for really\\nfresh eggs and farm butter.\\nTheHosieryBar\\nT\\nHE Hosiery Bar is an unusual way of making limited capital usable in\\nstarting one’s own business. Miss Hannah Hilb, owner-manager of the\\nHosiery Bar, Denver, found that she could take advantage of a part frontagein the center of Denver’s most popular downtown section. A lease was\\nsecured on an eight-foot-wide store at a nominal figure. A few alterations\\nchanged the front to a “baby store” with two miniature windows and a three-\\nand-one-half-foot door. The store, extending back to a thirty-foot depth, was\\ncarpeted with a remnant “buy.” Fixtures included the regulation side cabinets,\\ntwo display tables, and a specially made “bar.” The side cabinets and the\\ntables were cut down approximately twelve inches in their widths, finished in\\nglistening ebony paint, and trimmed in chromium.\\nThe “bar,” the main attraction in the place, was constructed on modern lines,\\nbeing a single piece of compo-board covered with ebony linoleum and\\nprotected and supported on each side with heavy chromium strips. Fashioned\\nin the form of an elongated “J,” the curve or tail was placed to the front of the\\nstore so that it curved under, forming one end support. The arm extended\\nback to serve as a twelve-foot service counter. All fixtures were purposely\\nnarrowed in their width to create the illusion of more space in the shop. These\\nfixtures, which were purchased second-hand, ran around $90—exclusive of\\nthe “bar.” The latter ran about $60, remodeling of interior $200, extras about\\n$50.\\nThe original stock was approximately $500. Stocks are purchased by Miss\\nHilb through an eastern buying agency, which enables her to get full\\ndiscounts with small orders. An average inventory runs about $1,500. With\\nthis amount of stock, Miss Hilb can offer her clientele a full range selection\\nand gross volume of approximately $50 a day.\\nThe location of the Hosiery Bar is such a good one, Miss Hilb feels that it is\\nsufficient advertising in itself. A special stimulant for introductory business is\\nused, however, in the form of a card which is presented to new customers.\\nWhen this card is punched out through the sale of twelve pairs of hosiery, it\\nis exchanged for one free pair.\\nThe Fat Men’s Shop\\nIN NEW YORK there is a men’s shop on lower Third Avenue which has\\ncatered for some twenty years to a special clientele—fat men. Here the\\noversize man can select suits, shirts, socks, shoes, and hats without the usual\\ndifficulties of being fitted in the average store. Even the clerks themselves are\\nof whopping dimensions in order that the customer may not be embarrassed\\nby any suggestion that he is an unusual specimen of the human race!\\nNaturally, only in a large metropolis can a special shop such as this find a\\nneed for its very special services. Cities, size of Detroit, Cleveland,\\nPhiladelphia, Chicago, New York, San Francisco, and Los Angeles, would\\nprobably offer markets large enough for such a specialty store. The same\\ncities would also offer a market for a similar store catering to the stout\\nwoman.\\nIn smaller cities, a special department catering to stout women or men is\\nusually located in the larger department stores. Any stout person will tell you,\\nhowever, that there is much room for improvement in these departments. The\\nalert retailer who can develop such a department to its fullest will find a\\ncorresponding increase in his income.\\nOpen a Drug-Less Drug Store\\nD\\nURING the Florida boom a young woman was sent by her firm to West Palm\\nBeach as assistant manager of a small branch. She found the new place\\ndelightful, made many friends and brought her mother to live with her. When\\nthe bottom fell out of Florida, however, the home office immediately closed\\nthe branch and recalled the staff. It was not pleasant to think of going north\\nagain, taking a clerk’s job in the home office (she couldn’t hope to step back\\nin her old position) and giving up the companionship of the good friends she\\nand her mother had made in the five years they had lived in West Palm\\nBeach. She realized that she would have to find some way to make a living in\\nFlorida! But how?\\nWhile buying some cold cream in a drug store the day after the notice cameto close the branch, Miss Oliver got the idea of opening a “drug-less drug\\nstore.” She reasoned that there were a great many items that people went into\\ndrug stores to buy that could just as well be purchased in a small attractive\\nshop that would cater especially to their personal needs. She had some money\\nsaved, and upon inquiry she found she could have a little shop immediately\\nthat would be quite reasonable to rent. She talked the idea over with her\\nmother and the two of them decided to try it out.\\nShe stocked three good lines of cosmetics—really three price lines—\\nincluding face powder, rouge, lipstick, creams, etc. Other purchases were\\nfour brands of tooth-paste, two brands of tooth brushes, some well-known\\ntoilet waters, soaps, bath salts, manicure instruments, sun-tan lotions and oils,\\ntalcums, and hair tonics.\\nHer “drug” section included such daily necessities as boric acid, witchhazel,\\niodine, mercurochrome, nationally advertised antiseptics, corn remedies,\\nvaseline, sunburn remedies, rubbing alcohol, adhesive tape, gauze bandages,\\nindigestion remedies, etc. In addition she stocked the four most popular\\nbrands of cigarettes, some chewing gum, razor blades, razors, shaving cream,\\nplaying cards, a good quality of plain white stationery, and the popular\\nmagazines. At the back of the store where it was cool and inviting was the\\nsoda fountain and sandwich counter. A good grade of ice cream was carried,\\nthe usual bottled goods, and a fine brand of coffee. Sandwiches were\\nprepared only on order and the lettuce, tomatoes, and other “fillings” were\\nkept fresh and crisp. No cooking was ever done in the store, consequently the\\nplace did not have that unpleasant odor so often associated with drug and\\nother stores which serve light luncheons.\\nWhile they were not aware of it, nevertheless, both mother and daughter were\\nthe sort that are exactly suited to handle a small retail business. Both were\\nnice looking, were immaculate in appearance, had cheerful, optimistic\\ndispositions, were friendly. They liked meeting and talking with people. And\\nthey were not afraid of long hours or hard work.\\nSpecial Corner Sells CosmeticsThe exterior of the store was pale cream stucco and instead of the usual\\nscreen door, the screen and frame were painted chalk blue and the screen\\npartially covered with lattice work also painted blue. This gave the store its\\nname, “The Blue Door.” Blue awnings over the windows and blue hurricane\\nshutters added to its distinctive appearance. The interior was a cool sea-blue\\ncolor and chairs at the tables were covered with flowered cretonne slip\\ncovers.\\nConvenient to the cosmetic corner were a low table, a reed settee, an end\\ntable, and a deep cushioned reed chair with a tall white screen behind it.\\nThese pieces of furniture were painted white and the cushions covered in the\\nfloral cretonne. In this corner face powders were mixed for customers and\\nperfumes tested for their fragrance, or lipsticks examined for proper color. It\\nwas a new idea for customer and proprietor to sit down and discuss the merits\\nof this or that product. Women who came into the shop for the first time were\\nagreeably surprised by its charm and particularly by this cozy little corner\\nwhere one could relax, smoke a cigarette and make one’s purchases at leisure.\\nThe first year was a struggle and the second year found her almost willing to\\ngive up and go back north. There was so much work to do, so many of the\\nsales were small items on which there was little profit, and to make matters\\nworse, during the first two winters the tourist trade fell to an alltime low.\\nHowever, when she talked it over with her mother, they agreed to try it\\nanother year. They were making a poor living but they were not yet willing to\\nsay “die.” The third year saw a pick-up in the winter tourist business which\\ntided them over for another year. By this time they felt that if they could keep\\ngoing at all it was better to be doing something that they liked than to be\\nmaking a mediocre living up north doing monotonous clerical work in an\\noffice.\\nIt is now ten years since the little store was started and the last three years\\nhave seen it grow into a real business. In spite of the depression, the store did\\nenough business to enable the owners to make a trip north each summer, to\\ndress nicely, to save some money and to buy a coupe. To the original\\ndepartments have been added a rental library, a stock of greeting cards, and\\nsome inexpensive bridge prizes and favors. During the busy season, anattractive young girl helps out in the store part time for “pin money.” She is\\nalso available when the daughter and mother wish to spend an evening with\\nfriends. While the store will never make either of them rich, they are both\\nliving well, saving money, free of debt, and are happy in their work and\\nindependence. That’s the big thing in having a business of your own. It\\nmakes you feel that you are somebody after all. So even though you may not\\nbe an apothecary, you can start a drug-less drug store in your town if you\\nhave the will and a little capital to carry you through the first few months.\\n“Dollar Pups” Make Pet Store Pay\\nI\\nT DOESN’T take much money to start a pet shop. It does take a good idea to\\nbring people inside the pet shop, however, and this, C. Kinowski learned\\nwhen he opened his pet shop two years ago in South Chicago. The store\\nspace was so large that when he moved in his stock of pets, cages, and\\naccessories, the space was far from being filled. So he built a cage along the\\nwall from the windows far back into the store. This 25-foot-long cage is built\\nentirely of wooden frames covered with a fine mesh screen and cost only\\n$36.\\n“I covered the floor of this cage with linoleum on which I spread a thick layer\\nof bird gravel,” Kinowski said, “and then turned a number of canaries and\\nother small birds loose in it. The birds were provided with nests and perches\\nand the whole display attracted a great deal of attention. People from the\\nneighborhood stood and watched the birds flying around the big cage. Some\\ncame in to ask questions, and bought canaries and parakeets, generally known\\nas love birds, on the spot. When I saw how much attention was being given\\nthis big cage I decided to make it more attractive, and placed some tall palms\\naround the outside to create a woodland appearance, partitioned it into\\nsections, and told my customers I was using it as a flight breeding cage. I\\ndon’t sell birds from this cage but let them breed. The young birds are\\nremoved and placed in small cages as they mature. The display value of the\\nbig cage with its nests and birds fluttering about, however, is incalculable.Display of Puppies Adds to Profits\\n“Birds were going well, so I partitioned a section of the window space into\\nrough and comfortable pens. In these I placed puppies. I put puppies of ages\\nfrom three weeks to two months old in the window, and you’d be surprised at\\nthe interest shown in them. This display was so effective that I was soon hard\\npressed to get enough puppies to fill the demand for them. Children,\\nespecially small boys, stand for hours with their noses pressed against the\\nglass, watching the puppies play. When these children get seventy-five cents\\nor a dollar, they bring it in and buy a pup. Most of these dogs are just dogs.\\nOf course, you couldn’t sell a pedigreed dog for so low a price. But these\\ndollar dogs go so fast that handling them pays more than enough for my rent\\nand lights.\\n“To secure enough puppies was a problem until I placed a small\\nadvertisement in a neighborhood paper, offering twenty-five cents for\\npuppies. In a few days, people came from near and far with puppies. These\\nwere dogs that would have been drowned or otherwise destroyed, so the\\nowners were glad to get something for them, and to know that the pups would\\nget a good home.\\n“One of the most important points to remember in starting a pet shop of this\\nsort is the need for cleanliness and sanitation. Unless your shop is thoroughly\\ncleaned once a day, it will begin to have an unpleasant odor which will repel\\ncustomers as soon as they enter the door. In addition, lack of cleanliness will\\nadd to the danger of disease of both birds and puppies and once disease has\\ngained a foothold, you may lose your entire stock. Cedar chips sprinkled\\namong the newspapers in the dog display window or cage will help\\nconsiderably to eliminate odors; cedar oil may also be used. In summer time,\\na ventilating fan at the back of the store will help to clear the air.\\n“The profits accumulating to the pet shop owner do not stop with the profits\\non birds, dogs, and other pets, however. There is a good profit in bird seed,\\nbird cages, bird gravel, dog food, medicine of various kinds for young dogs,\\nand accessories for pets.”Many pet dealers include in their stock a number of aquariums containing\\ntropical fish, and the accessories which go with aquariums for home use, such\\nas aquatic plants, fish food, and ornaments for their home aquariums. A pet\\nshop may be started with as little as $100 for stock and equipment, and space\\nmay be rented at a reasonable figure in a good location. Too much emphasis\\ncannot be placed upon attractively displaying pets and accessories since the\\naverage American’s love of animals forces him to stop and watch them, when\\nthey are displayed in a window. There are few easier ways of making money.\\nCashing In on the Tropical Fish Vogue\\nA\\nFEW years ago Ralph Watkins, a tropical fish enthusiast, opened an\\naquarium in Chicago’s South Shore district. He had eight kinds of fish at that\\ntime, and ten small tanks. At the end of three years, he had one hundred and\\nthirty tanks containing one hundred and twenty varieties of fish, was growing\\nhis own fauna, and netting well over a thousand dollars a year in this\\nfascinating business.\\n“I started with two hundred dollars,” said Watkins. “My rent was not high.\\nMy investment in fish amounted to a hundred dollars. Tanks, fauna, and\\naccessories took my second hundred dollars, and when I turned the key in the\\ndoor the first morning, I didn’t have a red cent in my pocket. A few children\\npassing on their way to school early that morning, had stopped to ask the\\nprice of goldfish and went on their way. I forgot them. Late in the afternoon\\nthey returned with several others. They were eager, curious and fascinated\\nwith the few tropical and goldfish I had in the tanks. One youngster wanted to\\nbuy a goldfish. For a moment she studied it, then solemnly said: ‘What will I\\ncall it?’ ‘What’s your name?’ I inquired. ‘Sonya.’ ‘This goldfish should be\\ncalled Sonya,’ I replied. That went over big. Before they left, each had\\nbought one or two fish which they named after themselves or other children\\nin the neighborhood, and I ‘rang up’ three dollars on the sale.\\n“Because the children liked the idea of naming the fish they bought, they\\ncame back again and again. When a fish appeared sick or died, they’d comein and say ‘Alice has a tummy ache,’ or ‘Henry died.’ Their parents took up\\nthe idea and laughed about it. When ‘Alice’ or ‘Henry’ passed out, I wouldn’t\\nknow what type fish it was, so to make sure, I’d go over to their homes to see\\nthe fish before replacing it. This gave me an opportunity to explain the proper\\ncare of fish to the mothers and fathers of the children, and to point out the\\ndecorative possibilities of the more expensive fish. Soon I was getting calls\\nfor tropicals that ran into money. Many of the species ordered were hard to\\nget. Furthermore, I did not have even those tropical fish that were easily\\nobtained. I had acquired some colored photographs of tropicals during the\\nprevious months, and carried them with me, showing them to the parents.\\nThese contacts proved valuable. As the average person knows little about fish\\nand their care, I took this opportunity to explain how the fish should be\\nhandled. Few at first were ready to buy, stating that they had little luck with\\nfish. So I adopted the policy of guaranteeing every fish, from the lowest-\\npriced Guppi, to the highest-priced Angel or Scalare in the shop. In each\\ninterview, in addition to telling how fish should be raised, I emphasized the\\nfact that tropical fish of most varieties will really live for many years, if cared\\nfor properly.\\n“I interested the neighborhood in tropicals as a feature of home decoration.\\nTo add to the species I had in the store, I bought some Red Helleri, Silver\\nTetra, Blue Gularis, Red Platy, Blue Gourami, twenty varieties of the Angel\\nor Scalare which retail from fifty cents to fifty dollars each, Calico Cichlidae\\nand many others. When a man wanted to place a beautiful aquarium in his\\nliving room, I was able to show him a good assortment from which he could\\nmake selections. The buyer seldom wants a common fish when he is\\nconvinced tropicals will live. He will not hesitate to buy rare varieties, after\\nhe starts an aquarium, and buys them as readily as he buys a new chair. The\\nadvertising value of having in stock rare tropicals which sell from fifteen to a\\nhundred dollars a pair, is incalculable. Even if I never sold one, I’d think they\\nwere well worth keeping on display in the store. They do not cost me much\\nmore than the Guppi to raise, and bring very high prices.\\n“Different kinds of fish require different kinds of water. Water is conditioned\\nby plant life growing in the aquarium. Most races of tropical fish require\\ntropical marine fauna, and because I’m one of the few dealers in my cityhaving a large, well-stocked store selling nothing but tropical fish and\\nsupplies, I grow in my own tanks the fauna which I sell to my customers.\\nRaising Tropical Plants\\n“I may upset some common notions about tropical plants when I say that\\nalmost all tropical fauna necessary to conditioning tropical fish are native\\nFlorida plants. Even the so-called Madagascar Lily comes from Florida. This\\nplant is easy to raise, and is pretty hardy. Some plants, however, are difficult\\nto raise and until you hit upon the right method of growing them, you will\\nhave little luck. For example, almost every aquarium man thinks it impossible\\nto raise the Sagittaria Guayanersis, a Florida plant. They have tried it in\\nmany public aquariums with little success. It fooled me, until I accidentally\\ndiscovered that this particular plant requires a great deal of room for its roots\\nto spread out. When the roots are cramped a little, the leaves become\\nspeckled, turn brown at the edges, and presently the plant dies. After learning\\nwhat it required, however, I have had no trouble with it at all. The\\nCryptocoryne Griffithii, which thrives only in sand, is the only plant from the\\nSouth Seas I use. I have four varieties of it, and have heard there’s a fifth,\\nwhich I’m trying to locate. One can obtain the seed or the cuttings of plant\\nlife at a very small cost, and in a year or two build up a surprisingly profitable\\nstock of marine fauna. The plants cost practically nothing to raise, but as they\\nrequire a great deal of light, I keep a lamp burning over each tank all the time.\\nI determine the price for plants and fish by the demand and the time I’ve had\\nthem. The longer I have them, the more I get for them. The fifty-cent Angel is\\nmy bread-and-butter fish. I raise this fish right in my shop at no expense and\\nit sells very fast.\\n“In selling tropical fish for home aquariums, there is one point that should be\\nstressed. The water should be conditioned by tropical flora for several days\\nbefore the fish are placed in it. Water should never be changed by emptying\\nthe aquarium and putting in fresh water. Salt should not be placed in the\\nwater. Water should be turned into the aquarium only when necessary to\\nreplace evaporated water. Water just out of the spigot is such a shock to\\ntropical fish they will die overnight.”A good plan for getting your store known in a district is to appear before the\\nnatural history classes in grammar and high schools several times annually,\\ngiving a talk upon the care and feeding of fish, and the many interesting\\nfeatures of owning fish. Such talks might profitably be given at church\\ngatherings and women’s clubs also. Handling as a side line such items as\\nhome aquariums, plants, fish food, decorative shells and aquarium ornaments\\nadd greatly to the profits of this interesting enterprise.\\nchapter eIght\\nPROMOTING A SMALL BUSINESS\\nI\\nT IS a precept of business that goods well bought are half sold, and that any\\nman who builds a better mouse trap than his neighbor will have a path worn\\nto his door. Like most business maxims these are only half true. No matter\\nhow desirable the thing you are selling may be, your ability to sell it is in\\ndirect proportion to the number of people who know what you have to offer.\\nThe job of spreading that news is, for want of a better expression, called\\n“promoting a business.”\\nIt is only within the last few years that the possibilities of “promotions”\\nhave been fully realized by business men. For a decade or more before the\\ndepression business men talked a great deal about the power of advertising.\\nAdvertising was held up as the modern Aladdin’s lamp that brought success\\nto all who touched it. Advertising still is a powerful business force. But\\ngradually men have come to appreciate that advertising alone is not enough.\\nIt is just one of a number of ways to promote a business. And so we find in\\nthe up-to-date business not only a man in charge of advertising, but working\\nhand-in-hand with him, a man in charge of promotion.\\nThe use of “promotions” as a means of short-cutting the good-will building\\nprocess, and increasing what is called “store traffic,” has reached its highest\\nstate of development in the department store field. Here we find the\\nmanagement always searching for new ideas and thinking up all sorts of\\nthings to bring people into their stores, and to get themselves talked about.\\nOne Chicago store, for example, spent thousands of dollars to put on a“Quality Exposition.” A section of the store was set aside for a display of\\nquality products featured side by side with inferior products. The differences\\nin value were made clear by tags and charts. Another store drew thousands of\\npeople into the china department by having prominent society women and\\nleaders of civic organizations set dinner and tea tables, which were displayed\\nin strategic locations. Big stores do not overlook a single trick when it comes\\nto turning the public eye their way, and getting people to talk about them.\\nThese promotional activities are becoming increasingly important and it\\nbehooves the smaller business man, whether he is the proprietor of a small\\nstore in a small town or a manufacturer, to use showmanship as well as\\nadvertising in promoting his business.\\nShowmanship in Business\\nIt is not necessary to spend thousands of dollars to put on a show that will\\nmake your business the center of interest and attention. During the depth of\\nthe depression a small jeweler in a little Indiana town found himself in a tight\\nspot with his creditors. His “working capital” was tied up in diamonds, and at\\nthat time diamonds were a drug on the market. How could he turn these\\ndiamonds into cash and pay his bills? He found the answer in a “diamond\\ncontest.” This contest was based on the inherent interest which people have in\\ndiamonds, and the general lack of knowledge concerning them. The jeweler\\narranged a display of diamonds in his window, and announced that he had\\nprepared a series of questions about the stones. He further explained that he\\nwould award, on a certain day, a valuable diamond ring to the person who\\nsubmitted the most complete answers to his list of questions. He had some\\nhandbills prepared, which were distributed door to door announcing the\\ncontest. He advertised in the newspapers. He got the school-teachers\\ninterested. In fact, so great was the local interest in the promotion that he was\\nasked by the Rotary Club and the Chamber of Commerce to address luncheon\\nmeetings on the subject of diamonds. But in order to participate in the contest\\nit was necessary for you to go to his store twice; once to get the list of\\nquestions and again to deposit your answers to the questions. That was the\\nhook. What happened? Not only did this jeweler make his store the main\\ntopic of conversation in town for more than a month, but hundreds of people\\nbecame interested in diamonds as an article of jewelry and as an investment.He quickly sold out his stock of stones and had to buy more. And that\\nhappened in 1932 when the banks were closed, and it was more or less\\nfashionable to be “broke.”\\nAnother sure-fire way to promote either a small or a large business is to hitch\\nyour wagon to a star—some celebrity who is visiting town. Then there is that\\nold reliable stunt of balloon parades. Recently Shell Petroleum opened a new\\nfilling station in St. Louis. Seldom, if ever, was a Hollywood opening more\\ncolorful than this service station opening. Clowns were on hand to service an\\nold model T Ford; executives in full-dress clothes serviced other cars and\\ngirls from the local Shell offices, dressed as chorus girls, helped entertain the\\ncrowds. More than two thousand cars were serviced in twenty-four hours.\\nGiant spotlights lit up the premises, bands played and speeches were made;\\nSt. Louis was fully conscious of the new station’s opening.\\nOne of the cleverest and best planned pieces of showmanship was the stunt\\nstaged in big department stores by Westinghouse to promote refrigerators.\\nThis company arranged with department stores to hold a style show. As the\\naudience assembled in the auditorium there appeared a row of Westinghouse\\nrefrigerators. Suddenly, from behind the refrigerators appeared a group of\\nbeautiful girls in negligee; the idea was that this scene represented milady’s\\nbusy day. From the refrigerator she took the “makings” of breakfast.\\nBreakfast over, the girls disappeared behind the refrigerators, and from out of\\nsight of the audience the filmy, lacy garments they had been wearing were\\nthrown over the refrigerators; by this time the audience was shivering in\\nanticipation—perhaps the girls would appear next in attire suitable only for a\\nnudist party!\\nBut the next appearance showed them attired for a morning activity of one\\nkind or another—riding, tennis, or other sports. After showing the sports\\ncostumes the girls retired again behind the refrigerators, changed to a\\ncostume suitable for luncheon. Each appearance called for a visit to the\\nrefrigerator. This program was carried out through a typical day of a busy\\nwoman, until supposedly late at night when the wives appeared with their\\nhusbands, ostensibly from a late theater party or a bridge game to raid the\\nrefrigerator for a midnight “snack.”Here was a double-edged promotion. First, Westinghouse got over the\\nessential idea that a refrigerator was about the most important tool in a busy\\nwoman’s activities, always on the job, always ready to serve in any\\nemergency food crisis, always saving time for the busy woman. Second, it\\nprovided a new idea and a new background for a style show, gave several\\ndepartments of the store an opportunity to display many different costumes,\\nincluding negligee, sports, afternoon, dinner, evening, and bathing, besides\\ndozens of accessories, so important in modern fashions.\\nA particularly spectacular stunt in showmanship was the famous\\ntranscontinental trainload of movie stars and electrical equipment which\\nGeneral Electric hauled across the country early in 1933. A brilliantly\\ndecorated train, with coaches equipped with demonstration kitchens, and\\nloaded with movie stars such as Leo Carillo, Bette Davis, Lyle Talbot, Tom\\nMix and others, visited many towns and was thrown open for public\\ninspection. Thousands of people thronged through the train and visited the\\ndealers’ showroom where the stars were in the reception line.\\nThis train pointed up the General Electric sales campaign and took the\\ndealers’ minds off the bank failures which became nationwide, just when the\\ntrain reached Cleveland on its eastward journey.\\nWhile the smaller business man cannot, of course, undertake promotions of\\nthis magnitude himself, it is usually possible for him to “tie in” with national\\nactivities and thus bring to his business whatever local sales value they might\\nhave.\\nPromoting a Business with Premiums\\nEverybody likes to get something for nothing. Even though it is a fact that\\nthere is no such thing in business as getting something for nothing, this time-\\nhonored method of attracting customers is as good as ever. Among the great\\nAmerican business institutions which have been built up on “gifts” are the\\nWilliam Wrigley, Jr., Co., makers of Spearmint gum, the Jewel Tea Co., food\\nproducts, and the Jas. S. Kirk Co., makers of American Family Soap. Each of\\nthese companies was started the same way—giving away something withevery sale made to the consumer.\\nThe story is told of a small soap manufacturer who made a powdered soap\\nthat was especially good for washing dishes. When he tried to sell it to\\ndealers they all gave him the “run around.” They said, “Our shelves are\\nloaded with a dozen brands of soap powder. We cannot afford to tie up any\\nmoney in soap. Go out and create a demand for your powder, and then we\\nwill stock it.” That was a stickler. How could he create a demand without\\ncapital? It took far more money than he had to put on an advertising\\ncampaign, and it was difficult to get enough volume selling door to door.\\nThat night he talked his problem over with his wife who was a practical sort\\nof person. “I’ll tell you what,” she said, “we have enough money to buy ten\\ngross of hand-towels, and you can get them at a low price from the mills in\\nNewburysport. Offer to give a towel away FREE with every purchase of two\\npackages of soap powder. I’ll bet you anything you like that any store in town\\nwill be glad to give you a window—it would draw the crowds and that is\\nwhat every storekeeper wants.”\\nThe idea of a free hand-towel with every two-package purchase caught on\\nlike wildfire. The merchant who cooperated with the soap maker and put in\\nthe first window sold hundreds of packages. The manufacturer was soon\\nbeing solicited by storekeepers who, only a week before, refused to have\\nanything to do with his soap powder. They just could not stand by and see the\\nwomen all going to their competitor to get the advantage of the special deal\\nhe was offering on soap powder.\\nAnother way to promote a small business is by enlisting the aid of the school\\nchildren. Just how this can be done, depends, of course, upon the nature of\\nyour business. But a live American youngster is just about the best press\\nagent you can hire, and best of all, his services may be obtained at a trifling\\ncost. An unusual shaped rubber balloon, offered on Saturdays with purchases\\nof a certain amount, is almost certain to bring dozens of doting mothers into a\\nstore with their young hopefuls in tow. Simple puzzles, that can be bought for\\nas little as two cents, draw the youngsters like magnets. Kites, “Fire Chief”\\nhats, cross-word puzzles, stamp albums, magic sets, pop-out or cut-out sets,\\npaper dolls, and clown hats are other premiums that have been used to attractchildren. About two years ago there was a “craze” for masks and their use as\\npremiums stimulated the sale of many a slow-moving product. These masks\\nincluded comic-strip characters, movie stars, clowns, etc.\\nDirect-Mail Advertising\\nOne of the great wastes in promoting what might be called a “limited” appeal\\nbusiness is spending money to contact people who are not prospects. It might\\nbe all right to stand on a street corner and shout your wares to all who pass, if\\nyou have something to sell to the masses. But if you can sell only to people\\nwith a certain amount of money, or to owners of automobiles, or to farmers,\\nor to some other specific class of people, then it is important in planning a\\npromotional activity—whether it involves showmanship or advertising, or\\nboth—to pick those upon whom your effort is to be expended. The more you\\nconcentrate your promotional effort, the more resultful and effective it will\\nbe. That is where direct-mail advertising comes in. It enables you to hand-\\npick those with whom you wish to do business, and focus your entire sales\\npromotional effort on them.\\nThe first step in using direct-mail is to build a mailing list. A good mailing\\nlist is the backbone of a business, and that holds just as true of the large\\nbusiness as it does of the small business. It is not enough to take a telephone\\ndirectory and call it a mailing list. That is just a list of names. A mailing list is\\nsomething more. It is a list of people you definitely know to be prospects for\\nwhat you have to sell. These names may be obtained through your own\\npersonal acquaintance, through friends, or by having a “survey” made by\\nsome person employed for the task. As a rule the money you invest in getting\\na good live mailing list is about the best investment you can make. Having\\ncompiled such a list, do not stop there. Spend a few dollars more for an\\naddressing machine and make the most of the names. You can buy a small\\nhand-addressing machine for as low as $25. You can use it not only to\\naddress advertisements to your mailing list, but also to print postcard\\nannouncements. You will find such equipment a big dividend producer.\\nRemember that a mailing list is no more valuable than the number of times it\\nis used. Get something out regularly—the more often, the better. Keep themailing list alive by adding steadily to the list of prospective customers. One\\nof the best sources for obtaining names of desirable prospective customers—\\nthe store’s own salespeople—has been overlooked or ignored by a majority\\nof merchants.\\nContest for Increasing a Store’s List\\nBy making the listing of possible new customers a game among their\\nsalespeople, the Tully-Abbott Company almost doubled the store’s list within\\ntwo weeks and impressed employees with the value of the names to the\\nestablishment. The contest also had a beneficial effect since its termination,\\nall of the clerks continuing to turn in names to be added to the store’s mailing\\nlist.\\nThe contest was announced through a bulletin addressed to employees by the\\nmanagement. It was to run for two weeks. Employees were provided with\\nspecial forms and asked to submit the names of people which they did not\\nbelieve to be on the store’s books or records at the time. It was expressly\\nstated that “good names” were those who, because of some quality of\\nstanding, wealth, or social position, might be desirable prospects to buy\\nmerchandise of the establishment.\\nThree prizes were awarded. The employee submitting the greatest number of\\n“accepted” names was given a $25 certificate entitling him or her to select\\nmerchandise of that value as a reward. The employee turning in the next\\ngreatest number was presented with a $10 certificate and the one contributing\\nthe third greatest number was rewarded with a $5.00 certificate.\\nTo guard against employees turning in names of no value as prospects, one of\\nthe questions included on the form was, “Why do you feel this person is a\\ndesirable prospective customer?” A number of names were thrown out\\nbecause the persons listed were unemployed or had no satisfactory business\\nor family connections. Other names discarded included those already on the\\nbooks or submitted during the contest by some other employee. Each entry\\ndeclined for contest credit was turned back to the employee who submitted it\\nwith the reason for its refusal clearly stated.At a time when waste in advertising is a particularly heavy tax on business, a\\ngreat many retail executives may find the Tully-Abbott plan worth\\nconsidering. When a list is top heavy with worthless names, a mailing has a\\nhard time paying out. Inaccurate lists entail a great waste of postage, time and\\nmaterial. The plan reviewed here is one that any merchant, regardless of line,\\nmay convert to his use. The awards may be increased, decreased, or\\ndispensed with altogether, without seriously affecting the success of the plan.\\nHonorable mention and a daily list of the standings of contestants would\\nprobably prove almost as successful as the use of awards in cash.\\nHow to Make Newspaper Advertising Pay\\nFor the average small business depending mainly upon one locality for\\npatronage, the accepted means of promotion is newspaper advertising. Just as\\ndirect-mail advertising has an advantage in selecting prospects, so newspaper\\nadvertising has an advantage in creating mass acceptance. It is the least\\nexpensive of all advertising, based on contacts made per dollar expended. It\\nis particularly useful to those operating a retail business in a community\\nserved by a good newspaper.\\nYet, like any other form of sales promotion, newspaper advertising must be\\nrightly used or not at all. Too many business men regard advertising as\\nsomething they can do when they feel flush, or they wait for some special\\noccasion and then “take an advertisement in the newspaper.” Such hit-or-miss\\neffort is not likely to do you, or the newspaper publisher, much good. The\\nonly effective way to make newspaper advertising pay is to have a plan—not\\na plan for a few weeks or a few months, but a plan for three years.\\nIn setting up your plan, decide first of all just what you expect your\\nnewspaper advertising to do. You want it to attract new customers, of course.\\nBut more than that you want it to build up in your community certain definite\\nimpressions about your business and its ability to serve. You know, or should\\nknow, that it is going to take time to create such an impression. “Taking an\\nadvertisement” once in a while certainly will not do it. You have to advertise\\nregularly, using a certain style of “copy” and building your advertising story\\naround one dominating idea which the public will associate with yourbusiness. Keep repeating that dominant idea over and over and over again.\\nThere will come times when you weary of it. But remember that good\\nadvertising is repetition. To quote the motto of a famous advertising agency:\\n“Keeping everlastingly at it brings success.” New ideas and changes of copy\\nare all right. Change your copy as frequently as you wish. But see to it that\\nyour advertising holds fast to two anchors—a distinctive style that gives it\\nindividuality and a dominant idea.\\nTo illustrate these principles in action, and to show you what a tremendous\\nforce well-planned advertising can be in promoting a small business, a few\\nexamples follow showing how small beginnings grew into goodsized\\nbusinesses through the untiring and intelligent use of good advertising backed\\nby persistence.\\nHow Harding Built a Restaurant Business\\nW\\nHEN John P. Harding opened his first Chicago restaurant, people paid little\\nattention to it. It was just another addition to the hundreds of restaurants in\\nChicago. The general public and restaurant people expected him to have a\\nfair business for a while, then the restaurant would settle down to a normal\\nenterprise that would do well if it broke even. Some even said there were then\\ntoo many restaurants in Chicago and Harding was foolish to start another.\\nHarding had a different idea, however, and his amazing success in the\\nChicago restaurant field—he now has seven restaurants—proves he knows\\nhow to ring the bell so far as attracting trade is concerned.\\nThere were several reasons why people came to Harding’s. Good food was\\npossibly most important. But the thousands upon thousands of firsttime\\ncustomers had to be sold on Harding’s service before they bought their first\\nmeal. Harding recognized this fact. He got them to come by appealing to\\nthem through small advertisements in morning newspapers. The unique angle\\nof the Harding advertising, the semi-humorous twist to the copy, and the\\ncartoons illustrating these advertisements did the trick for him. But he didn’t\\nstop with just small copy. He planned his advertising in advance and whenthe copy appeared, one window of the restaurant was always trimmed\\neffectively to tie up with the newspaper story. He began by featuring corned\\nbeef and cabbage in the advertising, and soon was known as the “Corned\\nBeef King.” Then he featured other special dishes. Soon he had many people\\ncalling at his restaurants to discover the secret of his good food—and they\\nkept coming.\\nThe windows frequently were trimmed with enlarged photographs of\\ndelectable food products, and the advertisements were planned to “tie in”\\nwith the seasonal eating habits of the public. Thus, just before Lent, and\\nduring Lent, the advertisements carried announcements of Lenten dishes.\\nShortly after the prohibition amendment was repealed, Harding ran an\\nadvertisement about ham, illustrated by a laughing little pig sitting in a glass\\nof champagne. The copy follows:\\nh aM happIness!\\n“Years ago before prohibition became a fact, the old Righeimer bar at 131 N.\\nClark Street (now Harding’s) was famous for its very unique treatment of\\nham. They didn’t simply slice off a piece of ham and place it between two\\nslices of bread. Oh no! First they dipped the ham into the most delectable\\nconcoction imaginable, champagne sauce. Ummmmm! Well, Harding’s have\\nresurrected the recipe and now—at all Harding restaurants the carver dips the\\nslices of our perfectly baked sugar-cured ham into champagne sauce before\\nmaking up the sandwich. Of course, if you prefer not to have the sauce just\\ntell the carver. But it is good . . . The price is still 15c.”\\nFrom the time these advertisements appeared in Chicago’s morning papers,\\nHarding’s restaurants became crowded daily. The cost of the advertising each\\nday was about seventy-five dollars. This expenditure, however, more than\\njustified itself. In smaller communities, where the cost of advertising is not\\nvery great, this same advertising would run but three or four dollars, and the\\nresults would be proportionately greater. Harding’s advertising ideas may be\\nused to good advantage to tell people about your roadside stand or small\\nrestaurant. The same advertising appeal he uses would attract people from\\nnear and far.Harding spent quite a lot of money in equipment and fixtures. By securing\\nused equipment, however, you may start your restaurant with as small an\\namount as $300. Eye appeal may be enhanced in trimming windows by using\\nenlarged photographs of the dishes you serve. Your local photographer will\\ntake these photographs for you and enlarge them to any size you wish for\\nthree or four dollars. By consulting your local newspaper publisher when\\nplanning your advertising, you may secure advance notice of special\\noccasions which might connect up nicely with your advertising. There are a\\nfew more lucrative forms of business than a well-managed restaurant whose\\nowner takes advantage of the many money-making opportunities advertising\\noffers.\\nA Change in Policy Started a Laundry on\\ntheRoadtoLeadership\\nL\\nIKE a great many other men in the laundry business, B. C. McClellan never\\ntook advertising seriously. To him it was just one of “those things.” He would\\nbuy an advertisement now and then just to be a good fellow and to make\\nhimself think he was advertising. Naturally, it never paid. One day while\\nhaving luncheon with a group of men, he voiced the old complaint that\\n“advertising doesn’t pay.” A young advertising man in the group said: “You\\nare wrong—advertising does pay. But perhaps your advertising doesn’t pay.\\nAnd I think I can tell you why—even without having any facts about your\\nmethod of advertising. You have no plan, no campaign. Isn’t that right? You\\njust take an advertisement because you think you should advertise.”\\nMr. McClellan had to admit that the man was right. The result of that talk\\nwas a little conference with the advertising man and the preparation of a plan.\\nWhen Mr. McClellan saw the plan, he was flabbergasted. It called for an\\nexpenditure of $5,000 over a period of one year. The idea of a laundry that\\nwas handling only 4,000 bundles a week, spending $5,000 for advertising,\\ntook his breath away. But the advertising man persisted, and finally Mr.\\nMcClellan agreed to try his plan.As the advertisements began to appear and the bills began to come in, Mr.\\nMcClellan felt tempted to withdraw from the arrangement. But he didn’t.\\nThen the advertising began to “take hold.” It wasn’t long before the business\\ngrew from 4,000 to 18,000 bundles a week.\\nThe advertising continued to pull. A dry cleaning business was started. The\\ngood-will which Mr. McClellan’s advertising has built up assures its success.\\nMethods were improved. Other laundries were opened. Within ten years it\\nhas grown to be the largest laundry in the world. Today there are McClellan\\nestablishments called the Laundry and Dry Cleaning Service, Inc., in fourteen\\ncities. A $5,000 advertising acorn grew into a $10,000,000 business.\\nMilo Jones Started His Sausage Business with a $30\\nAdvertisement\\nA\\nBOUT fifty years ago, the preacher in charge of the circuit of which Fort\\nAtkinson, Wisconsin, was a part, took dinner at the farm of Brother Milo\\nJones. Instead of serving the regulation yellow-legged chicken, the main\\nfeature of the meal was farm sausage of Mrs. Jones’s making.\\nThe pastor complimented Mrs. Jones profusely on the delicious flavor of the\\nsausage. As he traveled the circuit he praised Sister Jones’s sausage to other\\nmembers of his flock. Jones’s farm sausage was soon in demand.\\nOne day the thought came to Mr. Jones that if people in near-by cities knew\\nabout his good wife’s sausage, it might be possible to sell more. So he\\ndecided to advertise. Being a conservative New Englander his first\\nadvertising was very modest, just a few inches in a Fort Atkinson newspaper.\\nBut it brought results.\\nBefore Milo Jones knew it, his sausage had become famous throughout\\nWisconsin. Then he went after Chicago distribution, spending, of course, a\\nlittle more on advertising. In spite of the fact that he charged ten cents a\\npound more for his sausage, it soon became nationally famous and wasfeatured by leading hotels all over the country.\\nThe Jones’s business is not large compared to the great packing companies. It\\nhas purposely been held down by members of the family who were more\\nconcerned with their reputation than their fortune. Nevertheless, it is one of\\nthe romances of American business success—illustrating, as it does, the\\npossibilities of building a national business by expanding a market one step at\\na time with advertising.\\nRestaurant Which Caters to Children\\nA\\nRESTAURANT owner in a middle-western town has built up a lucrative\\nside line in his business by catering to children. He has special menus made\\nup listing wholesome dishes for children. Each dish, needless to say, is\\nattractively prepared to entice the most fickle appetite. The preparation of this\\nfood does not entail any special labor as many of the dishes appear on the\\nregular menu under different names. The children’s menus have a border of\\nchildren in silhouette—romping, jumping rope and playing marbles. The\\nfigures are stickers secured from a local novelty store and simply pasted on\\nthe daily menus. The portions listed on the children’s menus are usually\\nsmaller than those on the usual bill of fare.\\nAnother idea which has paid him well is preparing special parties for\\nchildren. If you understand youngsters, you know that anyone of them would\\nrather have a party in a restaurant than in his own home. A restaurant party\\nmakes a child feel so important and grown-up! Because his restaurant is in a\\nneighborhood of homes and small apartment buildings, there is an\\nopportunity to cater to quite a few children. He has also increased the number\\nof his youthful patrons by contacting the churches and schools in the\\nneighborhood, giving the youngsters special prices as inducements for\\nholding their parties and suppers in his place.\\nBridge Prize Puts Over Home LibraryI\\nT IS easy to start a circulating library but it is not so easy to get customers.\\nSo when Mrs. Gertrude Murphy started a library in her home, she decided to\\ndo something spectacular and unusual to attract customers.\\nShe had previously used a rental library operated in a neighborhood drug\\nstore in Chicago and found that the main reason the druggist lost “readers”\\nwas his unwillingness to add new books to the library. Three or four months\\nwould pass before the latest fiction was available.\\n“I’ll start a library and specialize on ‘best sellers,’” Mrs. Murphy decided. To\\nget going quickly she adopted the “door-prize” idea, commonly used at\\nbridge parties. Each time a member came in to rent a book, she was given a\\nsmall piece of pasteboard on which the date was stamped. The member wrote\\nher name and address on this card and dropped it into a box. On Wednesdays\\nand Saturdays of each week, the names of three members were drawn from\\nthis box and prizes, usually inexpensive articles such as ash-trays,\\nhandkerchiefs, or dishes, were given the lucky winners.\\nMrs. Murphy’s plan for operating the library was similar to that of the drug\\nstore’s. Books were rented at three cents a day and a dollar membership fee\\nwas required. This membership fee was used to buy additional books and in\\nless than a month she had one hundred and ninety books on her shelves.\\nMeanwhile eighty members were enrolled by the “doorprize” feature.\\nWomen frequently took out books for their husbands and daughters. At the\\nend of this first month, Mrs. Murphy discovered that each member averaged\\ntwo books a day. Her only investment was fifteen dollars spent at the outset\\nfor books, the membership and rental fees being sufficient to cover all other\\nexpenses.\\nYou can start a rental library on a similar plan with twenty books. Order\\ndirect from publishers or wholesale booksellers who will give you a special\\ndiscount. Well-selected books pay for themselves in rentals many times over\\nbefore they lose their popularity. It is advisable to have two or three copies of\\n“best sellers” on your shelves in order to meet the demand. The library can be\\nconducted from your home or you may be able to make arrangements withsome real estate office to give you desk space for a few dollars a month. You\\ncan pick up enough magazine subscriptions, if you are on your toes, to pay\\nthe rent. Obtain an agency from the American News Company, New York\\nCity, or one of the large subscription agencies such as the Franklin Square\\nAgency of New York. These companies publish catalogs listing all the\\nmagazines and quoting a dealer’s discount which is usually about 5 per cent.\\nReturnable Containers Pep Up Sales\\nG\\nREAT businesses have been built around a simple merchandising idea—\\nUneeda Biscuits, for instance. Before the National Biscuit Company hit upon\\nthe idea of putting up soda crackers in five-cent sealed cartons, people always\\nbought them sparingly because they were hard to keep crisp. The soda\\ncrackers are probably no better than they were before the sealed package was\\nintroduced but that idea made the business. Today all sorts of things are sold\\nin air-tight packages.\\nThe same opportunity for clever packaging exists today in such products as\\ncookies, butter, honey, and various specialties made in home kitchens. If you\\nknow how to bake good cookies, and offer them to a regular list of customers\\nneatly packed in air-tight cookie tins, which you pick up when the next tin is\\ndelivered, you have a merchandising idea that will greatly simplify marketing\\nyour product. As a matter of fact one woman in Naperville, Illinois, built a\\nprofitable cookie business doing that very thing.\\nA farmer in Geneva, Wisconsin, had the idea of delivering butter in sealed\\nthree- and five-pound crocks instead of the usual bricks. The crocks were\\ndesigned to fit into a small electrical refrigerator, and had a clamp to hold the\\ncover on tight. In this way the butter was protected from odors that it would\\notherwise absorb. The customer made a deposit of twentyfive cents when she\\nbought the first crock of butter, and the farmer picked up the “empties” very\\nmuch as a milkman picks up his milk bottles. These returnable containers\\nenabled him to increase his “unit of sale.”Another example: A woman in Ticonderoga, New York, who specialized in\\nputting up strawberry jam, doubled her sales when she thought of putting up\\nthe jam in the very latest style beer glasses generally known as “Pilseners,”\\ninstead of the usual preserve glass. They cost but very little more, and since\\nprohibition had been repealed and every woman needed up-to-date glasses\\nfor serving guests, the utility value of the glass proved to be just the needed\\ninducement.\\nAn Advertising Adventure Blazed the Path of Success for\\nWeber’s Bakery\\nI\\nN LOS ANGELES everybody knows about Weber’s bread. But that was not\\nthe case back in 1926. Dale Weber’s bakery was then just one of the many\\nbakeries that served that community.\\nOne day Weber’s bakery was singled out for an attack by organized labor.\\nMr. Weber decided to lay his case before the public through advertising. He\\nnot only won his case but found something even more valuable—faith in the\\npower of advertising. That new-found faith proved to be the turning point in\\nthe growth of the Weber Baking Company.\\nWhen Weber began advertising, his bakery operated 18 trucks. A year after\\nhe had launched his program, which called for an investment of $2,000 a\\nmonth, his business had grown to 42 trucks. He decided to plow back 3 ½\\ncents out of every dollar he took in, for advertising. By the end of the second\\nyear his fleet had grown to 65 trucks.\\nBut he did not stop there. He pyramided his advertising. Business continued\\nto grow. In another year the bakery was operating 84 trucks, and by the end\\nof the fourth year of advertising, 110 trucks were required to service his\\nsteadily expanding trade. A growth, roughly, of 500 per cent in four years.\\nOf course, advertising alone did not accomplish this noteworthy result. But it\\ndid play an important part. Who can say that had not Dale Weber, fightingwith his back to the wall, made that initial appropriation for advertising, what\\nmight have happened to his business. But he did make it.\\nHow $150 a Month Advertising Built\\na$10,000,000Business\\nB\\nACK in 1905, M. G. Gibbs opened a drug store in Washington, D. C. His\\nfriends told him he was foolish; that there were already too many drug stores\\nin Washington, and that there was no money to be made in the drug business\\nanyway.\\nBut Gibbs figured that there was always room at the top regardless of how\\ncrowded the field might be. He believed that if a business had distinctive\\npolicies and kept telling people about them, day in and day out, it was bound\\nto be successful.\\nSo he took his capital of $9,000 and set $2,000 of it aside for an all-year\\nadvertising program. This gave him $150 a month for his advertising. Then\\nhe took the remainder and bought fixtures and stock with it. Perhaps the fact\\nthat Gibbs was the son of a small-town publisher had something to do with\\nthe faith he had in advertising. But he stuck to his plan in spite of all\\ndiscouragements, and when the year closed his sales totaled $ 22,000. Not a\\nbad first year’s business back in 1905.\\nToday the Peoples Drug Stores are as well known in Washington as the\\nWhite House. They do a volume in excess of $10,000,000 annually and their\\ncredit rating stands ace high in Dun & Bradstreet. Druggists from all over the\\ncountry come to Washington to study the Gibbs methods. But the real secret\\nof the success, according to an interview which Mr. Gibbs gave to Printers’\\nInk, is his year-in-and-year-out policy of plowing back 2 per cent of his sales\\ninto advertising. “It is inconceivable to me,” he said, “that any retailer would\\nattempt to operate without a consistent plan of advertising year in and year\\nout.”Open-Air Market Brings Added Profits\\nA\\nNUMBER of years ago, a grocer owning his own store in a Chicago suburb,\\npurchased the adjoining lot on the corner because he had a chance to get it\\ncheap and thought he might want to enlarge his store some day. One day on a\\ntrip out into the country, it occurred to him that the roadside stands were\\ndoing an excellent business on fruit and vegetables that were no better than\\nhis own. The prices, too, were about in line with his. He thought of the vacant\\nlot alongside his store and decided to make an experiment. The next week, he\\nhad a carpenter build some stands and some uprights in the vacant space. A\\ncolorful striped awning was stretched from the side of the store to the\\nuprights, and the stands were loaded with vegetables and fruits. There was\\nplenty of parking space across the street. Almost from the start, this addition\\nto his store brought new customers. He kept it open from early spring until\\nlate fall and found that practically all of the new customers, attracted by the\\nopen-air market, continued to buy during the winter when the market was\\nclosed. The construction of the market required about $850, but through this\\noutlay he cleared around $7,500 net and increased his business in staples\\nconsiderably at the same time.\\nMixing a Good Time with Good Food\\nF\\nOUR months ago Howard Stevens rented a vacant house on a ten-acre tract\\nfifteen miles from Detroit, Michigan, along a much traveled highway, and\\nhere established a Wayside Inn. He stocked a few cases of beer, and some\\nsandwich meats, but did very little business the first month. Then he decided\\nto “doll up” the place. During the past two months, the result of his\\nimprovements has been to attract an increasingly large number of customers\\nto his place, and his profits have climbed.\\n“I discovered that to draw people you must have something besides a few oldtables and chairs and a couple bottles of beer,” said Stevens. “So I paid $275\\ndown on used bar fixtures and restaurant equipment, and agreed to payoff the\\nbalance of $640 in monthly payments. I got a couple of local carpenters and\\nhad them refinish the floor in the big room of the house for dancing, and\\nalong the sides of this room I then placed black and silver colored glass-top\\ntables of a modern, though inexpensive, design. I was lucky getting a semi-\\ncircular bar, and some long panel mirrors to hang behind it. My initial\\ninvestment, all told, came to $407, including the refrigerator and range for\\ncooking. I had a couple of electric automatic fryers,\\no n e t h o u s a n d Way s t o M a k e $1,000\\nand a grill and roaster in which I was able to roast up to nine chickens, or\\nfour pork loins at one time.\\n“To let people know about what I had to offer them, I had seventeen signs\\npainted and placed at strategic points along the road. Each sign featured a\\ndifferent type barbecued meat sandwich. I had the sandwich featured painted\\nin colors and placed a price of fifteen cents on each. Then in large letters was\\nthe name of my stand, and the distance from the sign to the inn. That first\\nnight I opened was surprising to me. Between six and nine, 119 cars stopped\\nand an average of three people came in from each car. My wife and I tried to\\ntake care of them, but we ran out of supplies at nine-thirty. We did volume\\nenough to indicate future success, however. We spent all the next day\\nroasting chickens, pork loins, and beef cuts and the business that night was\\nunusual. Many stayed a little while to dance and the small dance floor was\\ncrowded. Music was furnished by a good radio picking up a hotel dance\\nprogram from Detroit.\\n“People out in the country in their cars like to stop somewhere to rest and eat.\\nIf there’s a little dancing, they’ll stay longer. They don’t like to feel they are\\npaying excessive prices for food, however, and about fifteen cents is all\\nthey’ll pay for a sandwich. This is a profitable price. The average check runs\\nforty cents for each person. Inasmuch as there is a gross profit of 50 per cent\\non sales, we are doing nicely.”\\nEach week since he added the new equipment, Stevens has served sixhundred and three customers. He has two girls helping him take care of the\\nbusiness and pays them each $15.00 a week. His net profit for the week, after\\npaying all expenses, averages $89.67. There are many such opportunities for\\nopening wayside stands near big cities. Profits may be increased by placing a\\nfew pin games near the cash register, and by serving cold drinks.\\nUsing One Product to Sell Another\\nO\\nNE enterprising hardware merchant had a stock of bird cages on hand which\\nwere moving very slowly. As considerable money was tied up in his stock he\\nworried about ways and means of selling it. Finally he hit upon an idea. He\\npurchased 400 canary birds and offered them at $3.87, or practically at cost.\\nThe sale was advertised in the newspaper. His idea sold the 400 birds, 150\\nbird cages priced from $2.98 to $35.00, as well as many hardware items.\\nchapter nIne\\nSELLING THINGS BY MAIL\\nM\\nANY great fortunes have been made in the mail-order business, even though\\nit is one of the most exacting and difficult methods of making money. In\\naddition to skill as a buyer, a successful mail-order merchandiser requires a\\nkeen sense of dramatic values and sound sales promotional judgment. Given\\nthese attributes it is possible for an energetic person, with a small amount of\\ncapital, to start a mail-order business on a modest scale and successfully\\ndevelop it into a prosperous and worth-while business.\\nThe mail-order business is essentially American in its conception and scope.\\nIt is a by-product of the development of the West, when impassable roads and\\ngreat distances made it difficult for people living on farms or in small towns\\nto get a satisfactory selection of merchandise. The industry is scarcely fifty\\nyears old, yet in that short time it has developed sales running well over\\n$1,000,000,000 annually. This figure is interesting because it reflects a\\nconfidence on the part of the public in ordering by mail that is trulyremarkable, when you consider that the method requires a person to buy\\n“sight unseen.” The buying impression is created by the printed word, and the\\nbuyer must send his money on faith, depending only upon the assurance of\\nthe seller that his money will be refunded if he is not entirely satisfied.\\nThe first mail-order house to do a national, big-scale business was established\\nin 1872 by A. Montgomery Ward and George R. Thorne in a small room at\\n825 North Clark Street, Chicago. The initial capital was slightly over $2,400.\\nWard conceived the idea of selling for cash, direct by mail, while employed\\nas a clerk in St. Joseph, Michigan. Lack of capital prevented him from\\nputting his idea into execution at the time. To make the needed money, he\\nsecured a position as a traveling salesman for a St. Louis house. That was in\\n1871. He finally accumulated $1,600, which was a sizable sum in those days,\\nand persuaded his friend George Thorne, of Kalamazoo, Michigan, to go into\\npartnership with him in Chicago. The firm’s first catalog, a little pamphlet 3 x\\n5 inches in size, listing a few widelyused dry goods items, was issued in\\n1874. This was the forerunner of the giant mail-order catalog which is issued\\ntoday.\\nWhile credit for the idea of selling by mail belongs to Montgomery Ward, the\\ngreat strides which the industry made and public acceptance of the principle\\nof buying by mail are due to the pioneering work of Richard W. Sears, who\\nwas a better promotion man than Ward. Sears had a flair for dressing up the\\n“sales package”—one of the essential qualifications of a good mail-order\\nman. For that reason the story of his rise to fame and fortune should be of\\nparticular interest to anyone contemplating going into the mail-order\\nbusiness. Much can be gained by studying his approach to the varied\\nproblems that the new business presented, and the development of some of\\nhis policies. The story of how Sears laid the foundation for the great Sears,\\nRoebuck business is told elsewhere in this chapter.\\nEssentials of a Mail-Order Business\\nContrary to general belief, it is not practical to sell everything and anything\\nby mail. It must be remembered that conditions have changed a great deal\\nsince A. Montgomery Ward started his business. Good roads, the automobileand chain stores have narrowed the opportunities for general mail-order\\noperations until mail-order selling has become too speculative for the man of\\nsmall capital. But while the opportunities may be fewer for starting a general\\nmail-order business, the door is wide open for starting a specialized business.\\nNational advertising, the radio and the movies have done one thing for the\\nAmerican merchant that is not always appreciated. They have created a\\nmultiplicity of new wants, they have sharpened tastes, they have made people\\ndissatisfied with the garden variety of things bought in stores and have made\\nthem receptive to the specialized appeal. So we may set it down as principle\\nnumber one in starting a mailorder business that there must be something\\ndistinctive either about what you are selling, or about the way you sell it.\\nPeople will buy most easily things which they are not able to buy in local\\nstores, or because they feel that they are obtaining a definite price advantage.\\nIt is interesting to note, in this connection, that what gave Richard Sears his\\nstart on the road to success was not the kind of watches he sold but the way\\nhe sold them. When he became station agent at North Redwood, Minnesota,\\nhe had had some experience selling unclaimed merchandise. He found that\\npeople would pay top prices for such merchandise under the impression that\\nthey were profiting by another’s misfortune. So he conceived the idea of\\nbuying watches at wholesale, and sending them to fictitious names in care of\\nother ticket agents. When the ticket agent wrote him that the watch had not\\nbeen called for, Sears wrote back to sell the watch at a certain price, and\\ndeduct a commission for making the sale. While this is hardly a method that\\nwould succeed in these days, the principle which Sears used, that is to say\\n“staging the sale,” is just as effective today as it was then. It is not enough\\nmerely to offer to sell a man; you must develop and present to him some\\nreason why he should buy.\\nSince buying by mail requires complete confidence of the purchaser in the\\nseller, the name of the company or business is important. Use AngloSaxon\\nnames, if possible. One of the big mail-order houses, which successfully sold\\nwomen’s wear by mail for a number of years before being merged with\\nanother company, was the Charles William Stores of New York. This was\\njust a name. There was no Mr. Charles, nor was there any Mr. Williams. Had\\nMorris Rosenbaum used his own name when he started the National Cloak &Suit Company, it is doubtful if it would have been so successful. Generally\\nspeaking, it is better to use an easily-remembered family name than a\\ncorporate name. People are funny about names. They like to do business with\\nother individuals like themselves. They want to feel that if they are not\\nsatisfied with their purchase that they can write to the proprietor of the\\nbusiness and raise the dickens. It is less satisfactory to bawl out a corporation.\\nSimilarly there is a widespread notion that people with Anglo-Saxon names\\nare more trustworthy than people with foreign names. It is only a feeling, of\\ncourse, but when you are asking a man to send you his money solely on your\\nguarantee of satisfaction, you cannot afford to disregard even such trifling\\ndetails as public whims.\\nImportance of Repeat Orders\\nThe backbone of a successful mail-order business is its list of regular\\ncustomers. While it is possible to buy lists of people who buy by mail, and\\nthere are numerous directories from which names may be selected, it is a\\nmistake to think that a profitable business can be built up entirely from such\\nnames. True, some business can be obtained in that way, but usually the cost\\nof getting the business will absorb all the profit. With a good mailing list, the\\nbulk of which consists of names of people who have expressed an interest in\\nwhat you are selling, either by answering your advertisements or by having\\nplaced previous orders, selling costs can be controlled.\\nThe following table, showing costs of sales by mail to the consumer, is taken\\nfrom Wadsworth’s Mail-Order Handbook:*\\nAuto Tires, 3 ½ per cent Auto Supplies, 6 per cent Bicycles, 8 per cent\\nBooks, 20 per cent\\nFashions, 10 per cent Furniture, 8 per cent Gas Engines, 9 per cent Groceries,\\n5 per cent Hardware, 8 per cent\\nJewelry, 12 per cent\\nLighting Fixtures, 10 per cent Men’s Clothing, 8 per cent Pianos, 8 per cent\\nRedicut Houses, 3 per cent Shoes, 5 per cent\\nUnderwear, 6 per cent\\nIt will be noted that most of the above items represent products for which ademand exists. When it comes to products for which a demand must be\\ncreated, selling costs are much greater. For example, it costs almost 33 per\\ncent to sell a home-training course by mail. Many publishers figure the cost\\nof selling $2.00 subscriptions at 100 per cent. They must\\n*Published by the Dartnell Corporation, $3.75\\ndepend entirely upon their renewals for a profit. A good rule to follow in\\nselling products which are not in demand is to price them at three times their\\nproduction cost. This formula applied, let us say, to an article priced to sell\\nfor $3.00, allows $1.00 for manufacturing cost, $1.00 for selling cost, and\\n$1.00 for overhead and profit. The usual percentage of returns on mailings to\\nnew names is between 2 and 6 per cent, depending upon the acceptance\\nwhich the product has and the manner in which it is presented. On the other\\nhand, returns from a mailing directed to lists of known customers will run\\nanywhere from 10 to 20 per cent. These figures will serve to illustrate the\\nimportance of the “repeat quality” of a product, if it is to be sold by mail\\nsuccessfully, and the necessity of building the whole business around a list of\\n“known” buyers.\\nToo much emphasis cannot be laid on the importance of good “copy” in\\nselling by mail. The difference between a well-written letter or catalog and\\none that is indifferently written and produced can make all the difference\\nbetween a profit and a loss. There are no hard-and-fast rules which can be\\nlaid down for writing result-getting copy because very often success lies in\\nbreaking all the rules and striking out boldly along unblazed paths. The\\nfollowing suggestions by Ralph Wadsworth, well-known as a successful\\nmail-order copy writer, may prove helpful however:\\nWriting “Copy” to Sell by Mail\\nIf anyone thinks that mail-order copy is easy, let him try it. You will be\\nsurprised how many essential selling points you overlook. What they can\\nmean to your sales is best illustrated by the following: In Illinois a certain\\nfarmer made up his mind to buy a cream separator. Unable to make a\\ndecision from Montgomery Ward’s and Sears, Roebuck’s catalogs, he\\nhitched up his horse and buggy and drove around among his neighbors.Those with Sears’ separators acknowledged they were good; the ones using\\nWard’s were just as sure that theirs were the best. So he returned home\\nundecided, until his wife pointed out that Sears’ copy read “Guaranteed 255\\nlbs.” and Ward’s just said, “190 lbs.” Sears’ got the sale. As a matter of fact,\\nthe lesser weight is an advantage, but the Ward advertising man had failed to\\ncapitalize on the fact in the advertising copy.\\nBecause mail-order copy sells “sight unseen,” you must be very careful to\\nhave it cover every selling point, especially the appeals to the five senses. Let\\nus, for example, say that you are asked to write copy for a new velvet dress to\\nsell at $25. You might say, in the usual copy style:\\nWhat woman would not be delighted to appear in this beautiful velvet gown,\\n$25?\\nFrom a mail-order standpoint you would have overlooked many vital features\\nneeded to close a sale. You have not said anything about the style, the use,\\nthe comparative value, the kind of velvet, its wearing qualities, the\\ntrimmings, whether suitable for misses or women, the colors, sizes,\\napproximate length and perhaps use. To be complete your copy should run\\nsomething like this:\\nWhat woman would not be delighted to appear in this lastminute model of\\nrich-looking silk chiffon velvet, smartly finished with three-quarter sleeves of\\ngood-quality silk satin? Just the thing for afternoon or informal party wear.\\nThe material will give you excellent wear and the price quoted represents\\nunusual value. Length: 40 to 44 inches, according to size. Women’s sizes: 34 to\\n44. CoLors: Navy blue, red and brown. Special Price, $25.\\nIt does not appear difficult to write mail-order advertising for fashions,\\nfurniture, or cream separators, but until you have had plenty of practice you\\nwill be surprised how many essential features you will leave out of your\\ncopy. This training is a great help in handling general advertising copy, for it\\nmakes you careful to see that you do not overlook any points of selling value.\\nYour copy to retailers must naturally stress different points, but there are\\ncertain essential elements that must not be overlooked. You must emphasizethe profits to be made, the big demand and the popularity of your article, the\\nexceptional value it represents at the price you quote, as well as stating the\\nmaterial, sizes, weights or other information needed in order for your dealer\\nto send in his order.\\nThe above dress copy rewritten to the dealer should read somewhat like the\\nfollowing:\\nThis new Parisian model of good quality silk chiffon velvet is a fast seller in\\nthe New York market and should be very popular with your trade. Its satin\\nsleeves are a feature in great demand. At our exceptionally low price this\\nunusual number carries a good profit.\\nW omen’s sizes: 34 to 44. CoLors: Navy blue, red and dark brown. Prices: Each\\n$16; in quantities of six or more, specially priced, each at $15.\\nYou will note that copy to the retailer does not need to be so long as that to\\nthe consumer. Your dealer has a better conception of merchandise and does\\nnot require as much detail. Your terms, your guarantee and general reputation\\nwill have a great bearing on whether he sends you an order or not. The first\\nand last thing he is interested in is profits. That’s the angle you will\\nemphasize the most.\\nWhat Can Be Profitably Sold by Mail\\nAs stated at the beginning of this chapter, the building up of a demand for a\\nproduct which is presented through the mails to a possible buyer, depends\\nupon the way it is staged. It must have some distinctive quality, or there must\\nbe a distinctive plan for presenting it. For that reason it is desirable to build\\nyour mail-order business around products which lend themselves to\\ndramatization. There should be an apparent reason for a mail purchase. To\\nmake this clear, you will find below a few suggestions for products which\\nhave been successfully sold by mail.\\nspeCiaLized Books:\\nThere are many people who are always interested in books of a specializednature. Some are men in technical lines of work who are prospects for\\nvaluable technical books out of print. Some are interested in collecting first\\neditions. There is an opportunity to compile listings of books, both new and\\nsecond-hand, along a hundred specialized lines. The catalog should be sent\\nonly to groups composed of people with known interests. A by-product of\\nsuch an activity, particularly if you live in cities such as London, New York,\\nBoston or Philadelphia, is to purchase, upon order, rare books from dealers.\\nA fee is charged according to the time spent locating the book in the\\nbookstalls.\\nmonogrammed speCiaLties:\\nMost people have a weakness for monograms. A profitable mail-order\\nbusiness supplying monogrammed cigarettes, matches, playing cards, bridge\\nscores, place cards, tallies, glassware, stationery, etc., can be built up by\\ncatering to this interest. The same groups can be sold monogrammed shirts\\nand wearing apparel. It takes a little time and requires some capital to get a\\nlist of buyers together, since you have to depend largely on small\\nadvertisements in class publications, mailings to club members, etc. But once\\nyou have a list of buyers you have a business, because there is no end of\\nthings which can be sold through the personal monogram appeal.\\nArrangements can usually be made with manufacturers to fill your orders.\\nYou control the business through ownership of the monogram design.\\nhomespun neCkWear and Bedspreads:\\nIn districts which are recognized as headquarters for certain kinds of\\ncraftsmanship, it is possible for a wide-awake person to make money\\nmarketing the local output by mail. At the present time there is a vogue for\\nhomespun neckties. In the same category come homespun bedspreads,\\nhooked rugs, etc. While it is true, with the exception of neckwear, these\\nproducts do not repeat, a person who buys her husband a tie can usually be\\nsold a bedspread or a rug. In starting a business of this type it is important to\\nprice your merchandise to allow for a high selling expense. People buy\\nhandicraft work, not because of price, but because of certain distinctive\\nqualities. The price, therefore, is not so important as the proper dramatizationof the distinctive qualities of the product in your sales literature.\\ndistinCtive ConfeCtions:\\nA young couple in New Mexico made considerable money selling “cactus\\ncandies” by mail. A wide-awake advertising man in San Francisco, who\\nknew his way around the Chinese quarter of the city, built up a tidy business\\non rice candies, which he had made by the Chinese. A retired printing\\nsalesman in Florida took several hundred dollars out of the North every year\\nselling candied citrus peel in glassine packages. In each of these instances the\\nundertaking succeeded largely because the idea of having candy that was\\n“different” appealed to certain types of people. Here again success depends\\nupon the mailing list. Only a few out of every hundred people are prospects\\nfor mail-order candies. But once a list of buyers has been built up, a steady\\nincome is assured.\\nindian reLishes:\\nIt is also possible to make money by importing food delicacies from abroad\\nand selling them by mail. In this case the secret of success is finding things\\nwhich cannot be bought in food stores. An enterprising Englishman, who\\nonce lived in India, made a lot of money and established what is now a\\nprofitable business, by arranging with a manufacturer in Bombay, India, to\\nship him on consignment curries, relishes, and similar delicacies. He prepared\\nan attractive catalog, illustrated to give it an East Indian atmosphere, which\\nfeatured these novelties and explained how they were used in India. The\\nappeal here was to natural human curiosity. People like to try things which\\nthey have never tasted, just so they can say they have tasted them. The\\ncatalog was advertised in magazines going to wealthy people, and from those\\ninquiries he built up a good list of customers. By constantly changing his line,\\nand adding food specialties from other countries, he got the needed volume of\\nrepeat business to make the undertaking profitable.\\nMaking Your Letters Pull\\nThere are few factors more important in building a mail-order business than\\nthe ability to write business-getting, good-will-building letters. Fortunatelythis skill can be acquired. It is really more of a knack than anything else. It is\\nsimply the ability of being able to express yourself in writing, in a natural,\\nfriendly and effective way—by being able as one mail-order man expressed\\nit, “to climb into the envelope and seal the flap behind you.”\\nThere are two primary things that make a sales letter pull. The first of these is\\nan understanding of human nature, and the second, the ability to express\\nyourself in a letter so that you can make quick contact with a problem of\\nparamount importance to the prospect or customer. This is sometimes\\nexpressed as the ability to be able “to touch a live nerve.”\\nAnother essential is to be able to put personality into every letter you write.\\nSo many letters are cold and stilted. They read very much as though they are\\nbeing ground out on some sort of nickel-in-the-slot machine. Other letters\\necho the personality of the writer, who literally stands out behind the letter\\nextending his hand toward you.\\nTo illustrate what is meant by a knowledge of human nature, a correspondent\\nwas assigned to draft a follow-up letter for an advertising record which a\\nmanufacturing concern had sent out to a list of concerns with the idea of\\ngetting them to place a trial order. The advertising record was a miniature\\naffair and the card which accompanied the record requested that it should be\\ntaken home and played on the prospect’s phonograph.\\nWhile this seemed to be a good advertising stunt, and caused lots of\\ncomment, it did not produce the number of replies which had been expected.\\nSo it was decided to follow it up with a letter.\\nThe first letter which was drafted was purely and simply a reminder that the\\nprospect had not replied. It asked if he had tried the record on his phonograph\\nas requested. If he had, would he be good enough to answer it. This follow-up\\nletter was not particularly successful, so another letter was written. The\\nrevised letter was written by the sales manager himself, and in it the prospect\\nwas asked to give his opinion of the advertising record as a selling idea. It\\nwas explained to the prospect that the plan was to use these records as a\\npermanent part of the sales program, but before doing so the sales managerwas anxious to find out what he thought of this method of advertising. The\\nletter wound up with a paragraph asking authority from the prospect to send\\nthe order which was requested in the phonograph record.\\nThe returns from the second follow-up letter exceeded the returns from the\\nfirst letter three times over. The conditions were practically the same, but in\\nthe case of the second letter the sales manager had used his knowledge of\\nhuman nature.\\nHe knew what the first writer did not know, that everybody has decided\\nopinions on the best way to advertise, and by asking their opinions you not\\nonly flatter them but they jump at the chance to air their opinions. This is\\nexactly what happened in this case.\\nThere are a great many ways where this knowledge of human nature can be\\nbrought into play when writing a sales letter. Nine-tenths of the sales letters\\nwhich go out fail because the writer does not understand that point. The\\nwording, the phraseology and the grammatical construction of the letter are\\nvery important it is true, but after all the plan is the thing, and it is much\\nbetter to have a letter with a good plan and poor phraseology than it is to have\\na letter with no plan and the best grammar in the world.\\nSo many letters ramble about and get nowhere. To read them is like watching\\nan eight-ring circus. After you have read them you have no definite\\nimpression—just a mass of jumbled words. Make your letters paint a picture.\\nAll the words in the dictionary won’t sell goods. Only ideas, indelibly\\nimpressed on the mind of a reader, will provoke action. Another reason some\\nletters don’t pay is that the writer forgets that the person he is writing to is not\\nmuch interested in what he is writing about. On the contrary it has been\\ndemonstrated that seven times out of ten, the recipient of a letter, especially if\\nhe is a business man, will read only the opening paragraph, take a flying\\njump at the middle and then examine the last paragraph to see what it is all\\nabout and how much it costs.\\nThe most successful sales letters are those which carry a complete selling\\nmessage in the last paragraph. The practice of spending a lot of time inwriting a letter and then enclosing a return card which gives the man the\\nwhole proposition in a nutshell without any sales setting is common. It has\\nbeen found by many tests that when a return card is enclosed with a letter, or\\nwith a circular, that most business men will read the return card first because\\nthey have learned by long experience that they can get the whole proposition\\nin a nutshell from the return card with a good deal less effort and a good deal\\nless reading than they can from the circular itself. It is therefore fatal in\\nplanning a sales letter to tell too much in the return card. Some very effective\\nletters have depended upon perfectly blank cards, on which the recipient\\njotted down his reply in his own way.\\nThe Mechanics of a Good Sales Letter\\nWhen a sales letter is produced on the typewriter, and is a personally dictated\\nletter, it is important that it be planned in such a way as to invite reading\\nrather than repel reading. Many of the most prominent business concerns are\\nvery lax in the proper construction and technical arrangement of their\\nbusiness correspondence. Every concern should have a manual of style which\\ncan be turned over to a stenographer when she is first employed and which\\nshe can follow. Such a manual is the most practical way to build up standards\\nin your correspondence. It not only saves the time of the stenographer, but it\\nis good to fall back upon if some of the older stenographers become careless.\\nSuch a manual of style should discuss, first of all, “Clearness.” It should\\nimpress upon both the dictator and the stenographer the importance of\\nmaking a letter clear. That is to say—in using short sentences and\\nparagraphing it properly; also punctuating it correctly so that the meaning\\nwill be easily followed. The use of long words should be mentioned\\nparticularly. Language which is understood by the highly educated man is not\\nalways so easily understood by the man of average education.\\nIt was said of Cyrus Curtis, of the Curtis Publishing Company, that a great\\ndeal of his success was due to his ability to edit letters. He was adept at\\nwielding the blue pencil. One of his regular stunts was to take the last\\nparagraph of a letter and put it up front.It is a common fault of inexperienced writers to kill their story with a drawn-\\nout introduction. Business men who wouldn’t think of going into a prospect’s\\noffice and opening a sales canvass with funny stories, think nothing at all of\\nstarting a letter with some grotesque yarn which they drag into the letter by\\nthe seat of the pants. There are even so-called letter experts who insist on\\nbeginning every letter they write with some far-fetched introduction which\\nhas no bearing at all on the product being sold.\\nThese experts justify the practice from the standpoint that it gets attention.\\nBut if a letter writer has such a poor grasp of the problems of the man he is\\nwriting to, as to be unable to contact with him that way, he is not qualified for\\nthe work at hand. The American business man wants no long drawn out\\nintroductions. He wants you to come to the point quickly. Reading his\\nmorning’s mail is a duty he wants to get over with just as soon as he can and\\nget on with the business of the day. He has no time for jaunts out into\\nfairyland.\\nToo Much “You” Is Worse Than Too Much “We”\\nNearly all of the articles which have been written on the subject of letter\\nwriting lay emphasis on the “you” idea. They tell the reader that if his letters\\nare to be successful he must talk to the prospect about his problems, about his\\ntroubles and his trials, and he must never for a minute talk about the desires\\nor wishes of the man who is writing the letter or refer even in any way to his\\nbusiness. In fact, you would almost imagine it a sin or crime to use the word\\n“we” in a letter. It is true that the closer a writer can get to his reader, the\\nbetter results are going to be; and it is also true that nothing interests a man so\\nmuch as himself. The salesman or the sales letter writer who can talk to him\\nabout himself is sure to have his interest. On the other hand, however, this\\n“you” business can be and is being overdone. While the principle behind this\\nidea is perfectly sound, the execution of it is too often abused by writers of\\nsales letters.\\nTESTING CHART FOR LETTERS Selling Qualities of the Letter\\nComposition of the Letter1. is the start effeCtive?\\nBe careful it does not challenge the reader and put him into an antagonistic\\nframe of mind. When possible give it a new start, or embody it in the reason\\nfor writing. Don’t start off from nowhere.\\n1 d oes it invite reading?\\nAre paragraphs short and margins wide? Is it free from erasures? Is the\\nsignature legible?\\n2 d oes it appeaL to the reader’s seLf-interest?\\nThe motives that make men act are: (1) Love; (2) Gain; (3) Pride; (4) Duty;\\n(5) Fear; (6) Self-Indulgence. Unless your letter appeals to these motives in\\nan irresistible way you will not get action.\\n2 is it easY to understand?\\nBreak up all involved sentences into several short ones. Use a sentence for\\neach idea. Be careful about pronouns; be sure that the reference is clear in\\neach case. Avoid parenthetical and explanatory clauses.\\n3 d oes it make him Want What You are seLLing?\\nYou cannot sell a man something he does not want. If you are selling a chair\\nmake him think how nice it would feel to lounge in a big easy chair and\\nsmoke his after-dinner cigar.\\n3 i s the aCtion Continuous?\\nBlue pencil all meaningless words and phrases. Get the message you want to\\nconvey clearly fixed in your mind and make each step in the letter a step to\\nthat end.\\n4 d oes it Create ConfidenCe? Are you asking him to take your word—a stranger\\nwhom he has never even met—that what you say is true? Why not use a\\ntestimonial paragraph and let someone else tell about your virtues? What\\nprovision have you made in case he is not satisfied?\\n4 d oes it refLeCt Your personaLitY? Tone down extravagant statements that will\\ngive the impression you are a braggart. Let it carry an atmosphere of sincerity\\nand desire to serve. Be watchful for superlatives and the use of the word“very.”\\n5 d oes it ask for an order?\\nRemember people are not mind readers. You may know perfectly well why\\nyou are writing them and what you want them to do—but do they?\\n5 i s it grammatiCaLLY CorreCt? Have you used “was” when you should have said\\n“were”; “who” in place of “whom”; “differ with” instead of “differ from”;\\n“shall” instead of “will,” etc.\\nThere is quite a difference between getting a “you” point of view into a letter\\nand going over a letter and changing the “we’s” to “you’s” as so many\\nwriters seem to do. If the letter has a “you” point of view and is built up from\\nthat angle, it doesn’t make any difference how many times you use “we” or\\nhow much you say about yourself, because what you do say about yourself\\nwill be of interest to the man you are writing to. How can he do business with\\nyou until he knows about you? For example, suppose you are selling soap.\\nYou are pardonably proud of the fact that your soap is nearly pure—purer,\\nperhaps than any soap sold at the price. You work hard to acquire a\\nreputation as a quality soap maker. You have made many sacrifices in order\\nthat your customers should know you as being fair and honorable. If you are\\nguided wholly by instinct, you are inclined to harp on these points in your\\nletters, but the man to whom you are writing doesn’t care nearly as much\\nabout these things as he does about what your soap will do for him.\\nLet the Other Fellow Shout Your Praises\\nThe tone of a letter makes or breaks it. The skilled salesman knows this and,\\nconsequently, strives in his letter to give it an atmosphere of restraint rather\\nthan of extravagance. There has been a lot of fun poked at such expressions\\nas “we beg to state,” “your obedient servant” and “with your permission.”\\nPerhaps these are a bit unnecessary, but they at least serve to give a letter a\\ntone of humility which is pleasing.\\nNothing influences the tone of a letter more than the fault of shouting your\\nown praises, which so many letter writers seem to feel is necessary. In order\\nto do this they overindulge in superlatives and make a lot of statements whichmay be perfectly true but which strengthen the doubts of a skeptical prospect.\\nA master letter writer always tones statements down to a point where they\\nwill be accepted on their face, even if he has to understate the truth. He\\nseldom, if ever, indulges in superlatives. Particularly is he careful not to\\noveruse the word “very.”\\nThe letters of both Lincoln and Franklin, while not sales letters, are\\nnoteworthy for their tone of sincerity and deference to the opinion of others.\\nCommenting on humility as a factor in dealing with men, Benjamin Franklin\\nsays in his autobiography: “I cannot boast of much success in acquiring the\\nreality of this virtue, but I have learned a good deal with regard to the\\nappearance of it. I made it a rule to forbear all direct contradiction to the\\nsentiments of others, and all positive assertions of my own. I even forbid\\nmyself, agreeably to the old laws of Junto, the use of every word or\\nexpression in the language that imported a fixed opinion such as certainly,\\nundoubtedly, etc., and I have adopted instead of them, I conceive, I\\napprehend, or I imagine a thing to be so and so, or it appears to me at present\\nto be so and so. When another asserted something that I thought an error, I\\ndenied myself the pleasure of contradicting him abruptly, and in answering I\\nbegan by observing that in certain cases or circumstances his opinion would\\nbe right, but there seemed to me to be some difference. The modest way in\\nwhich I proposed my opinions procured for them a readier reception.”\\nThere is a great deal of truth in Franklin’s assertion, and in our letters to our\\ncustomers and to our prospects we are wise if we avoid making assertions\\nwhich challenge credulity, or in any way make it appear that we are trying to\\nexaggerate the virtues of what we are selling.\\nIf the virtues of our products must be expounded, let it be done by means of\\nenclosures. Quite often we get letters from our customers which can be\\nmarked up in such a way that the heart of them is quickly found, and these\\nletters can be used to bring out a point we want to get over.\\nAsk for the Order\\nYou probably have had experience with the very friendly and agreeableyoung salesman who drops in on you every day and talks about the weather\\nand everything else under the sun, but who never gets to the point of telling\\nyou what he wants or what he wants you to do. These salesmen are good-\\nfriend makers, but usually poor order-getters. The same thing holds true of\\nwriters of sales letters. There are many who can write a very human and\\ninteresting sales letter which will be read by the people to whom it is sent, but\\nit fails to get the business. It brings back many favorable replies but\\ncomparatively few orders.\\nThe trouble is the same in both instances. The salesman doesn’t get the order\\nbecause he doesn’t ask for it, and the man who writes the letter doesn’t get\\nwhat he is after because he doesn’t come out clearly in his letter and tell the\\nprospect what he wants him to do.\\nNo sales letter should be allowed to go out unless it ends up by telling the\\nrecipient just exactly what action you want him to take, and make it as easy\\nas possible for him to take that action.\\nThis does not mean that some hackneyed expression such as “Do It Now” or\\n“Send Back the Card Today” is all that is needed. Neither does it mean that\\nthe letter should conclude with some domineering, arbitrary demand that the\\nprospect do certain things without giving him any reason at all for doing\\nthem. But it does mean that a properly constructed sales letter will lead the\\nprospect through the stages of attention, interest, desire, and conviction up to\\nthe final stage of action.\\nIf the presentation is allowed to stop before the action stage is reached, all the\\nwork which has been done will have been in vain. So, be sure in your letters\\nthat in the last paragraph, or at least in the last few paragraphs, you make it\\nclear that you are writing to the person for a definite purpose, and the reason\\nwhy it is to his advantage to do what you want him to do. Then tell him what\\nyou want him to do so as to start the ball rolling. If you want him to sign an\\norder, ask him to sign an order. If you want him to send back a reply card,\\nask him to send back a reply card.\\nA SpareTime Business Became the World’s LargestMail-OrderHouse\\nR\\nICHARD W. SEARS , founder of Sears, Roebuck & Co., made his first\\n$1,000 in 1884, in a spare-time mail-order business under the name of the R.\\nW. Sears Watch Company. He wrote his letters with pen and ink in his\\nleisure hours. Later, when his correspondence demanded more time than he\\ncould spare, he enlisted the aid of a railroad man working on a near-by\\nsection. From this humble start grew the greatest mail-order house in the\\nworld. Soon Mr. Sears’ spare-time work became so profitable that he\\nresigned his position as telegraph operator, moved to Minneapolis, and\\nstarted in the mail-order business in real earnest with $8,000 which he had\\nmanaged to save.\\nIn the late eighties he moved to Chicago. He continued to prosper. Then a\\nChicago firm made him an attractive offer for his business, which he\\naccepted. A condition of the sale was that Mr. Sears should not engage in the\\nmail-order business in Chicago for a period of five years. When the transfer\\nwas completed, Mr. Sears returned to Minneapolis. At this point the level-\\nheadedness of the man is shown in a striking manner. He was not yet twenty-\\nfour, yet he had over $100,000 in the bank, made entirely by his own efforts\\nin the mail-order business. The possession of such a large sum of money by\\nso young a man is often a signal for erratic actions. But it affected Mr. Sears\\nnot a particle. His first step was to buy his mother a home. Then he invested\\nthe major part of his capital in Minnesota 8 per cent farm mortgages. He\\nnever parted with this investment.\\nHe started again in the mail-order business in Minneapolis. At this time, Mr.\\nRoebuck worked for him as repairman. They later formed a partnership and\\nthe new business grew by leaps and bounds. The advantages of Chicago as a\\ndistributing center appealed strongly to Mr. Sears. So at the end of the\\nspecified five years, he moved again from Minneapolis to Chicago. This was\\nin 1895. Mr. Roebuck stayed with Mr. Sears about four more years.\\nMr. Sears was a prodigious worker. He would work eighteen hours a day forweeks at a stretch. In the early days he originated all the ideas and plans used\\nin the business, and wrote his own copy. Once on the trail of an idea, he\\nwould forget all about time and would stick until it was developed, or at least\\nin condition to turn over to an assistant.\\nMrs. Sears often complained good naturedly about his devotion to business.\\nWhen he left home in the morning she never knew just when he would return.\\nSometimes she would hear from him at his office in the early morning hours;\\nother times the following day from one of his factories several hundred miles\\nfrom Chicago, or from a train bound for New York. He never let up until the\\nthing in hand was completed, even though it took him to distant parts of the\\ncountry.\\nWhen building an advertisement or a catalog, thoughts of economy never\\nentered Mr. Sears’ mind. The main idea was to get it right. He was never\\nreally satisfied with his work and would take an advertisement or a catalog\\npage which had just been printed, look it over carefully and suggest changes\\nthat would give the copy the right appeal or appearance. He would order\\npages that had been already set in type set up all over again.\\nThe first advertisements were his famous “Send-no-money” series. When\\nthey appeared, the advertising world stood aghast. These advertisements\\nviolated every principle of good advertising. They were small sized, closely\\nset in fine type, full of detailed description, hard to read, and without\\nheadings. They began “Send no money. Cut this advertisement out, return to\\nus, and we will send you . . .” Nobody believed people would read such small\\ntype. But Mr. Sears felt that if the subject matter was interesting, people\\nwould not want to miss a single word. And he won his case.\\nAnywhere from five to twenty advertisements of this type appeared in each\\nissue of a big list of publications, with from twenty to thirty million of\\ncirculation in the aggregate. Bills for advertising ran from $50,000 to $60,000\\na month and the campaign distributed millions of dollars’ worth of\\nmerchandising. At the same time he was building up his immense catalog\\nmailing list.During the 1907 panic, Mr. Sears showed his real mettle. Sales had dropped\\noff on account of money being tight. However, he reasoned that people still\\nwanted things even though they had no ready cash to buy them or feared to\\nspend what money they did have. In order to overcome this attitude, Mr.\\nSears wrote on a slip of paper the following: “If you haven’t the ready money\\nto send us with your order, send us anything that looks like money. Your\\npersonal check or your clearing-house certificate will do, and will be\\naccepted as cash.” This advertisement was broadcast through the entire\\ncountry. Millions of these slips of paper were printed and mailed each week.\\nWith every letter or package sent to a customer, one of these slips was\\nenclosed.\\nThe entire plan was startling, to say the least. When others were retrenching,\\nMr. Sears boosted and the result was such a flood of orders, resources of the\\ncompany were taxed to the limit. By doing the unusual, Mr. Sears reaped\\nunusual results.\\nBecause he believed that merchandise should be thoroughly described in the\\nadvertisements, Mr. Sears went the limit on description. He wanted to be\\ncertain that the prospective buyer would know from the advertising just what\\nhe would receive for his money. In an advertisement for suits, for example,\\nhe would even go so far as to describe the linings of the coats and the buttons\\n—even the buttonholes were mentioned.\\nOne of his policies was that merchandise must be guaranteed. It was his\\ncontention that the customer was always right and no matter what it might\\ncost to satisfy a customer that satisfaction had to be made. When a customer\\ncomplained that the merchandise he received was not right, he was told to\\nreturn the goods, even if he had used them, and his money would be\\nrefunded. There was never any backing out on this position—the money was\\ninstantly returned without question.\\nHe insisted that his goods must always be as represented and he backed up\\nthis policy by offering to send goods C.O.D. Mr. Sears was probably the first\\nmerchant to send his goods subject to approval with transportation charges\\nguaranteed both ways. He was always willing to take every risk himself—thecustomer had to be protected by every safeguard.\\nAnother policy which probably originated with Mr. Sears was that of placing\\nemphasis on the personal element in all his advertising. Letters were always\\nphrased in a personal tone and every letter was signed by his name rather\\nthan by the name of the company. He wanted every customer to feel that he\\nwas dealing with a flesh-and-blood person rather than an institution. He\\naddressed customers in their own language, in a simple, neighborly way that\\nthey could easily understand. Each letter breathed honesty and sincerity, and\\na genuine desire to serve.\\nHe knew that country people were not used to writing and found it difficult to\\nexpress themselves easily. He also knew that the mental inertia of people,\\ngenerally, prevented them from sending for goods. He had to get these\\npeople, who did so little writing, to send him an order. To overcome all these\\nobstacles he originated the “Do This” style of advertising. Advertisements\\nread: “If you want this catalog, simply write us a letter or a postal, and say\\n‘Send me your big catalog,’ and it will go to you by return mail, postpaid.”\\nHe also knew that there was usually a scarcity of writing material in the\\naverage country home, so he would say in his advertisement: “Write to us in\\nyour way, in any language; we will understand and will fill your order\\ncorrectly. If you haven’t an order blank handy, use any plain paper; use\\npencil or pen—it makes no difference. Don’t be afraid of making a mistake.\\nWe will take all the risk and will return your money immediately, including\\nwhatever you paid for freight or express charges, if the goods are not\\nperfectly satisfactory.”\\nMr. Sears believed that after a man had accumulated a fortune in business, he\\nhad earned the right to retire. With this idea in mind, he began early in his\\nbusiness career to build up an organization which would be able some day to\\ncarry on without his guidance and management. It was in 1908 that he\\nwithdrew from the active management of the business. He died in 1914.\\nA One-Man Business with a MillionCustomers\\nBACK in the eighteen-nineties, the sight of a young man driving his horse and\\nbuggy along the lonely country roads became a familiar one to the farmers of\\nsouthwestern Iowa. His name was Henry Field, and on the buggy seat beside\\nhim rested a basket of seed packets which he sold from farm to farm in the\\ncountry and from house to house in the small towns and villages. He had\\nplanted, raised and prepared that seed in his own garden. He had even printed\\nhis own seed packets, and after he had filled them he went out himself to sell\\nthem. His was strictly a one-man business.\\nThere weren’t any large towns down in southwestern Iowa in those days.\\nThere weren’t any surfaced roads, and sometimes there weren’t any roads at\\nall. He had to cut across fields to reach some of the farmers who bought his\\nseed. But whether the temperature was 110 in the shade or down below zero,\\nwhether the roads were heavy with dust or hub-deep with mud, Henry Field\\nwas on the job. He brought more than seed to the isolated farms he called on;\\nhe brought helpful suggestions about planting, news about what other farmers\\nwere doing, information about the need for good seed in getting good crops.\\nBut most of all he brought friendliness and encouragement. The farmers and\\ntheir families got to know him and to like him. They looked forward with\\neagerness to his visits. They talked about him with their neighbors.\\nBefore long these customers wanted to buy more of Henry Field’s seed than\\nhe alone could raise and deliver. He thought he was well enough acquainted\\nwith his customers to get their orders by mail just as well as in person. That\\nwould permit him to devote his full time to producing and shipping the seed.\\nSo he got hold of some second-hand printing equipment in Shenandoah,\\nIowa, printed a modest catalog, and started a mail-order business.\\nThe Knack of Appealing to Farmers\\nThrough years of personal dealings with them, he knew how to appeal to\\nfarmers as successfully by the written word as by the spoken word. First of\\nall, he must make his story brief and to the point. As he himself once\\nexpressed it: “When you’re driving along the road on a freezing day and meet\\na farmer taking a load of corn to market, you can’t make him stop and shiver\\nall day while you’re talking to him. You have to tell him your business in justas few words as you can, get his order, and let him go on to town. Well, it’s\\nthe same way when you write him a letter or send him a catalog. You’ve got\\nto get down to cases right away.”\\nThat doesn’t mean, though, that Henry Field’s letters and catalogs didn’t\\nradiate the same friendliness and intimacy which had made him so successful\\nas a salesman. He didn’t make the mistake of writing in a literary or\\n“bookish” way. He simply wrote the same way he would talk to a man if he\\nmet him face to face. He used the common, everyday colloquial expressions\\nhis customers used. He treated them as though they were his next-door\\nneighbors. He even gossiped a little, but was careful not to be long-winded\\nabout it.\\nFrom the start, people liked his way of doing business. They got in the habit\\nof sending in their orders by mail, and it wasn’t long until orders began\\ncoming in from people he had never called on in person, from Nebraska,\\nMissouri and Kansas. Year by year his catalogs grew larger and larger, but he\\ncontinued to write them in the first person and he never deviated from the\\nfriendly, personal, informal style which established his early success.\\nToday the Henry Field Company in Shenandoah, Iowa, has over a million\\ncustomers on its books. Its volume of business has grown from a few hundred\\ndollars a year to $3,000,000. In addition to selling seeds and plants, Henry\\nField has branched out into the general merchandise field. He sells overalls,\\nshoes, hats, prunes, oranges, tires and an endless variety of other products. In\\norder to sell them successfully by mail, he developed many innovations in the\\nestablished mail-order practices. Finding it unprofitable to sell a single pair of\\noveralls, for example, he sells them in units of three. Since farmers buy\\npotatoes, apples and corn by the bushel, he thought they’d also buy oranges\\nby the bushel, so that’s the way he sells them. Coffee is packaged in three-,\\nfive-, ten- and twenty-five-pound containers. Canned goods are offered only\\nin units of twelve. Although stores sell prunes in one-, three- and five-pound\\npackages, Henry Field sells them only in twenty- and twenty-five-pound\\nunits.\\nUsing the Radio to Create Consumer AcceptancesTen years ago he bought a run-down radio broadcasting station in\\nShenandoah, rehabilitated it, and has used it ever since to sell even more\\ngoods by radio than he ever sold strictly by mail. He is now known as a\\n“radio-order” merchant as well as a mail-order merchant. He does most of his\\nown broadcasting, and where once he called personally on hundreds of\\ncustomers, then wrote letters and sent catalogs to thousands, now his voice is\\nheard by literally millions throughout the whole Middle West. In the twenty-\\nfive years from 1899 to 1924 his mail-order sales grew to a $600,000 annual\\nvolume. Since he has been able to get closer than ever to his customers over\\nthe air, they have grown to $3,000,000.\\nBut in spite of the huge plant which his business occupies, in spite of the\\nacres of fields where his seeds, plants and bulbs are now grown, in spite of\\nhis broadcasting station and the huge department store which covers the\\nground floor of the building, all the million customers on the books of the\\ncompany still feel that they are dealing directly with Henry Field. They may\\nnever have seen him in person, although each year close to half a million\\nfarmers and small-townspeople visit his plant, but through his letters and\\nbroadcasts and catalogs they feel that he is an old and trusted friend. That’s\\nwhy they continue sending in their orders by mail at a rate of a thousand\\nevery day.\\nReaching the Smoker by MailJ .\\nW. ROBERTS and Son sells its entire production of fine Havana cigars\\ndirect to the smoker by mail and has been selling them this way for over 30\\nyears. The firm, of course, depends upon a carefully compiled mailing list to\\nsecure the right type of customer. This mailing list is made up from\\nthousands and thousands of rated names every year. New mailing lists are\\ncontinually purchased but rated names alone can be used as the company\\nwants only names to which it can make shipments on open accounts. Many of\\nthe standing-order customers have been on the books for twenty years and a\\nlist of their names reads like pages from Who’s Who.\\nExperience has proved that it pays to test a mailing list three times before\\nsending out a mailing to the entire list. In no other way can the probable\\nreturns of a list be estimated; and in no other way can expenses be kept down\\nto the point where mail selling is profitable. Test mailings on lists are made\\nas quickly as possible, for if any appreciable time elapses between the test\\nand the actual mailing entirely different results would be obtained. The men,\\nwhose rated names compose the lists, receive personal letters from J. W.\\nRoberts and Son by first-class mail, offering to send them, strictly on open\\naccount (no cash and no C.O.D.) a box of Havana cigars. The smoker is\\ninvited to smoke ten or more free. He is billed in the usual manner if he is\\npleased with the quality and the price and indicates that he wants to keep the\\nbox.\\nGiven a quality product, one which many people use, a product not too costly\\nto ship, simple sincere sales letters, and a “quality” mailing list, and you have\\nan excellent set-up for a fine mail-order business. That it can be done has\\nbeen proved by this 30-year-old business, still going strong.\\nchapter ten\\nSELLING YOUR SERVICES\\nT\\nHE first thing to do is to take an inventory of yourself. What do you like todo? What can you do especially well? What can you do skillfully that most\\npeople do indifferently? What need exists which you could fill? These are\\njust a few of the searching questions which you should ask yourself before\\nattempting to sell your services. If you can find the right answers to these\\nquestions, you will have little difficulty in establishing yourself in a personal\\nservice business.\\nNow there is a difference between selling your services and getting a job. In\\none case you are what is called an entrepreneur, while in the other case you\\nare an employee. Just what is an entrepreneur? He is a man who takes the\\nrisks that go with a business venture, and profits or loses in proportion to\\nthose risks. He derives his income from customers or clients, as the case may\\nbe, rather than from an employer. The entrepreneur may be, and usually does\\nbecome, an employer. But he still assumes the risks and the possibilities for\\nprofit that go with them. It is from the entrepreneur class that most of our\\nsuccessful business men, merchants and manufacturers come. They usually\\ngot their start selling their own services. Then, as they acquired skill and\\nknowledge, they branched out and sold the services of others on whom they\\nin turn made a profit.\\nIt is an axiom of success that to receive the applause of the multitude you\\nmust find out what your public wants and then do it better than anyone else in\\nthe world is doing it. The foregoing applies particularly to artists— those\\nwhose services take the form of entertaining or educating people. But it also\\napplies to less colorful work. To achieve success in any human activity, you\\nmust excel others. When you have done that, your reputation will be made\\nand your success will be assured.\\nThe thing which you select to do need not be—in fact, it should not be—a\\nbroad activity. The more you concentrate your interest, the more quickly you\\nwill succeed. In Chicago, there is an advertising man who discovered twenty\\nyears ago that very few men knew how to write inspirational letters to\\nsalesmen. He further discovered that there was a need for interesting,\\npractical, informative letters which would actually help salesmen to meet\\nsuccessfully the difficult problems they daily encountered. So he quit his job\\nand offered his services to sales managers of companies which employedsalesmen. In some cases these sales managers could have written just as good\\n—perhaps better—letters than this advertising man offered to write for them,\\nbut they did not have time to do it. They were too engrossed in the activities\\nof their jobs. So they were glad to pay the young advertising man $10 a\\nmonth to write a weekly letter to their salesmen. Since salesmen’s problems\\nhave much in common, the young man found that the same letter, with a few\\nchanges, would work equally well for any business, and within the year he\\nwas receiving $10 a month from more than 200 companies for his services,\\nAt the age of twenty-seven he was earning over $20,000 a year! Yet, had he\\nbeen employed by any of these companies on a salary, he could not have\\nmade more than $7,000 at the most. What was the secret of his success? It\\nwas simple. He became expert at doing one thing better than any other person\\nin the world was doing it. If he had set out to be a better advertising man than\\nanyone else in the world, he would still be on the way up the ladder. But he\\nlifted out of the selling field one little thing: A service for which a need\\nexisted, and then he concentrated all his efforts and thought on doing that one\\nthing superlatively well. In other words, he was a specialist.\\nThis principle of specialization is most important in our modern complex life.\\nIt applies not only to business, but to whatever we do. To be able to do many\\nthings well is an asset and a credit. And perhaps the world needs more\\nversatile people. But when it comes to making a thousand dollars quickly by\\nselling your services, specialize. We are living in an age of specialists.\\nDoctors specialize because they know that the big opportunities in medicine\\ngo to the one who thoroughly masters one particular disease or concentrates\\non one certain part of the body. The general practitioner served a very useful\\nrole in our community life. It is too bad to see him pass. But the big money in\\nmedicine lies in specializing. The same is true in law and in educational\\nactivities. It is true in engineering. People will pay a premium to get the\\nadvice or the opinion of those who are recognized as knowing more about the\\nparticular thing in which they are interested than anyone else in town, or in\\nthe country or in the world.\\nTraining Gave Chapin a StartG\\nETTING the “first thousand” didn’t worry Howard Chapin so much as\\npreparing himself to get it. When he left high school, he considered technical\\ncourses offered by various schools, and decided to go in for mechanical\\nengineering. He didn’t have enough money to matriculate at a university, so\\nhe decided to do the next best thing—get a job, and take a correspondence\\ncourse. That was five years ago. Today, Chapin is operating a successful\\nengineering service of his own. It’s small, but his profits for the past year\\nhave been a few times a thousand dollars.\\n“When I decided to study engineering, I went to the office of an engineering\\ncompany here in Chicago, and explained that I wanted more than anything\\nelse an opportunity to get an education. I agreed to work for a small salary. I\\nwould be satisfied, I told them, if it would barely cover the cost of my\\ncorrespondence course. The manager thought I had the right idea. ‘That’s\\nhow I got started myself,’ he admitted, and arranged to take me into his\\noffice. Supplementing the correspondence work was class instruction which\\ndidn’t interfere with my hours at the engineering company. With the practical\\nsuggestions I picked up in the office, plus the practice work and theories\\nstudied in class, I soon saw that I was getting somewhere.\\n“It took me two years to complete my correspondence studies. Meanwhile, I\\nwas advanced to a better position, and a raise in salary. I saved every cent of\\nthis raise, having accustomed myself to living economically during the period\\nof my school work. Something went wrong with a big job my employers\\nwere handling during my third year with them, and they were forced out of\\nbusiness. Without a job, I analyzed my future. I had saved a hundred and\\nninety dollars and I was qualified to do specialized work. I wrote out a list of\\nthe places that had use for such work and called on them. I found many small\\nfactories where motors were being neglected because it didn’t pay to keep a\\nfull-time electrician. This looked like a good opportunity to me and I began\\ncontracting to keep such equipment in good condition and service it monthly\\non a yearly contract. I called upon factories, laundries and such places where\\nthere are motor-driven shafts and machines, and charged a service fee ranging\\nfrom five to fifty dollars a month, depending upon the amount of work. Iagreed to furnish labor for repairing and installing equipment, and for\\nmaintaining it on this basis. In four days I had contracts from seven concerns,\\ntotaling $104 a month. I did the work myself and it kept me going seventeen\\nhours a day for almost a month. Those motors certainly were in bad\\ncondition! After that, it was easier and since there were now only a few days’\\nwork to be done each month, I called on a number of other firms, and signed\\nup five contracts totaling $120. Again I found that the equipment had been\\nsadly neglected for a good many months, and that I had to work my head off.\\nI was now assured of an income of $224 a month for a year. However, as I\\nstill had some idle time on my hands, I sallied forth for another batch of\\ncustomers.\\n“At the end of four months, I had signed up twenty-one companies on\\ncontracts totaling $885 a month. This was too much work for me to do alone,\\nso I hired two good electricians, paid them the full union wage, supervised\\ntheir work, and got more contracts. Profits quickly mounted. In less than a\\nyear, my contracts were paying me a profit of $490 a month, and I was\\npaying full regular union wages to five good men.”\\nChapin offers a service much needed in every manufacturing community.\\nMen trained and skilled as mechanics might do well to follow his example\\nand offer a similar service to small manufacturers at a regular, reasonable,\\nmonthly fee.\\nThey certainly will be welcomed by the smaller manufacturer who is at\\npresent worried about costs, and who may be permitting machinery to operate\\nwithout the necessary repairs.\\nAFlower-a-DayService\\nG\\nURNEY CHRYSLER , an alert young New York advertising woman, had a\\nsuspicion that florists could get more business if they went after it, instead of\\nwaiting for it to come to them. So she rented a loft in an old building and sent\\nout announcements advertising her flower-a-day or bouquet-a-week“service.” For one flower a day she charged 10 cents and for two a day, 15\\ncents. Those who wished this service contracted to pay her by the week or\\nmonth. Within a short time she had 1,000 customers.\\nMrs. Chrysler’s work begins at four-thirty each morning, when she goes to\\nmarket, buys her flowers, and starts her helpers making the boutonnieres. By\\neight o’clock, messenger boys have started to deliver the packages. Her\\ncustomers may have their order varied any way they choose—a rosebud on\\nMonday, a carnation on Tuesday, a gardenia on Wednesday, and so on\\nthrough the week. Customers may also contract to have flowers sent daily to\\nfriends who are ill.\\nAnother idea Mrs. Chrysler inaugurated was the anniversary service. You\\nturn over to her a list of the anniversaries in your family and flowers are\\ndelivered automatically on those exact dates, the bill being sent to you once a\\nmonth, according to contract. In addition to these regular services, she\\nprepares special table decorations for parties and arranges for floral\\ndecorations for weddings, teas, bridal showers, coming-out parties and other\\nsocial functions. She also makes up special floral designs, many of which are\\nsent to Paris salons and London parties. The use of the cellophane box by\\nflorists today originated with Mrs. Chrysler.\\nMargaret Harper, of Cleveland, has somewhat the same idea but depended\\nupon her own garden for her flowers. For years she had been an enthusiastic\\ngardener, and the grounds about her old home bloomed with flowers of many\\nvarieties from spring through the early autumn. This was the one subject in\\nwhich she was most interested and enthusiastic. Her beautiful arrangements\\nof cut flowers within her home brought as many compliments as her garden\\ndid. Having the time, the flowers and the artistic ability to arrange them, all\\nshe needed was a list of customers. She knew nothing about advertising, but a\\nfriend who owned a letter shop prepared some clever little folders for her at\\ncost and she addressed the envelopes on her son’s portable typewriter. The\\nlist was made up of names of friends and acquaintances she knew who were\\nin business; all the professional people she knew, such as her banker, lawyer,\\ndentist, the principal of her son’s school, some of the teachers of the school;\\nthe owners of several hotel apartment buildings near her section of town; theheads of small business firms within walking distance, and the managers of\\ntwo tea rooms and a restaurant a few blocks away. Many of these\\nannouncements were followed by personal calls and with practically every\\ncall she sold the idea to the prospective customer. Her two young sons\\ndelivered the flowers each morning and once a month Mrs. Harper collected\\nthe money for them. This personal contact with her customers gave her a\\nchance to handle any complaints and also the opportunity to sell her\\ncustomers on other uses for her flowers. Through subtle suggestion, she\\nsecured many orders for table decorations, decorations for parties, weddings,\\nbridal showers, “new baby” baskets, and holiday festivities. During the\\nwinter, she bought her flowers from the flower market and continued the\\nservice to her customers at a slightly higher cost.\\nTwo young New Yorkers also found the establishment of a flower service a\\nway out of their difficulties. They had been wearily trudging from\\nemployment office to employment office looking for jobs until one day they\\nrealized that the only way to get a job was to make one. They pooled their\\nresources which amounted to the grand sum of $1.50 and started in business.\\nWith their “capital” they purchased a thousand business cards and distributed\\nthem on foot from office to office, hotel to hotel, restaurant to restaurant. A\\nlittle sales talk went with the distribution of each card. Today, they have built\\nup a nice little business. Having no capital left to buy the flowers would have\\nmade things difficult for them if a wholesale florist had not agreed to wait\\nuntil the tenth of the month following their purchases to bill them. This\\narrangement gave them time to collect their money before the bills fell due.\\nSince they have access to the wholesaler’s stock at all times, there is no need\\nfor them to invest in stock of their own. The flowers are sold on a monthly\\nfee basis and the bouquets are changed every third day. The fee depends, of\\ncourse, upon the number of bouquets furnished.\\nRug Washing Is a Quick-Profit Business\\nE\\nDWARD ANDERSON washed his first thousand dollars out of otherpeople’s carpets. And he surprised himself at the ease with which he\\naccumulated the money. He started in this unique way of earning a living\\nwhen he lost his job as a manager of a department store in central Ohio,\\nwhere a carpet-washing machine, specially made to wash carpets and rugs,\\nwas used in the store.\\n“I wrote the manufacturer of this machine and learned I could buy one on the\\neasy payment plan,” said Anderson. “So I hustled around the neighborhood\\nand got a few orders for cleaning rugs without removing them from the floor\\nat one dollar and fifty cents a rug. Then I mailed my initial payment to the\\nmanufacturer. Full instructions for operating came with the machine. When I\\nstarted on the jobs ordered, though, I was surprised that I could clean rugs in\\nabout one-third the time I had figured. During one morning I cleaned seven\\nrugs and pocketed ten dollars and fifty cents.\\n“That afternoon I went around the neighborhood looking for more\\nrugcleaning orders. I secured my first orders without any trouble. I\\nexperienced some difficulty getting more, however. Most housewives\\nthought I might ruin an expensive rug, or wouldn’t efficiently clean carpets\\nfor the price I quoted. One woman said: ‘I can’t see how you can do it so\\ncheaply, if you do a good job.’ I explained the way the machine operated in\\nvain. She wouldn’t believe it. Others said they didn’t want their rugs cleaned,\\nand then quizzed me about the kind of work I was doing.\\n“I asked each of these women to call up the people whose rugs I cleaned that\\nmorning, but they wouldn’t bother. Going home, I listed the number of office\\nbuildings, offices, hotels, and apartment buildings in town. I called upon the\\nmanagers of those places the following days but got only thirty dollars’ worth\\nof work during the balance of that week. This wasn’t bad. The second week,\\nhowever, was a disappointment and I wondered how I would ever get enough\\nbusiness to pay for the machine. I began to make desperate efforts. I argued\\nand pleaded for orders, but it seemed that I always called just after rugs had\\nbeen cleaned.\\n“One day it occurred to me that if people did not need rug cleaning at the\\nmoment I called, they might need it later, so I had some cards printedexplaining the kind of service I was offering. These didn’t bring me any\\nimmediate orders, however, and the time for the first payment on the machine\\nwas drawing near. I called back upon my first customers then, and asked\\nthem if they could send me to some friends. One woman said that she would\\nsee some of her friends the next day, and let me know. Two days later, she\\nphoned that a friend on the other side of town wanted her rug cleaned, and\\npromised if I did as good as claimed to get me additional business. I lost no\\ntime getting over to do the job, and was rewarded with three additional\\norders. Then I wrote the manufacturer and asked if there was a better way to\\nget business than I was using. The company sent me a good deal of solid\\ninstruction in salesmanship, which I carefully digested. I found that my\\nmethod of getting the business was too “high pressure.” I was antagonistic\\nwhen people didn’t agree with me. I changed these tactics, and the difference\\nin my reception was amazing. In two months, I was becoming known for my\\npleasant manner and uniform good nature. A courteous manner toward\\nprospects made them listen to me.\\n“Politeness also smoothed a path for me in approaching the managers of\\noffice buildings and hotels. One hotel manager with whom I quarreled the\\nfirst time I called on him gave me a job cleaning the carpets in the corridors\\nof the hotel. This work brought me ninety-three dollars, and took thirteen\\nhours to complete. I didn’t get that order on the second or the fifth call,\\nhowever. But I was as polite and courteous as I could be each time I called\\nback on him. I had learned my lesson. In one office building, after many calls\\nupon the manager, I was able to get orders from tenants totaling $107,\\nbesides twelve dollars’ worth of work from the building owners.”\\nAnderson’s experience has convinced him that the value of courtesy and\\npoliteness in sales work cannot be overemphasized. He charges one dollar\\nand fifty cents for cleaning a nine by twelve rug, and does the job in twelve\\nminutes. Daily profits average about sixteen dollars. The machine operates\\nfrom a light socket with electric current, on the rotary brush principle, and is\\nfully guaranteed to do satisfactory work by the manufacturer. This machine\\nwashes the carpet with soap and water, which are fed into the brushes by a\\npatented process. However, it is impossible for the machine to spill water or\\nsoap upon the floor, or injure the rugs in any way. Anderson’s totalinvestment, which included the price of the machine, was $317.\\nStarting a Package Delivery System\\nT\\nWO years ago, James Overhause took his last hundred dollars, bought a\\nsecond-hand truck for thirty-five of them and spent several dollars fixing it\\nup. He had a sign painted, and announced to the world that he was in the\\nexpressing and moving business. But nothing happened. He sat around the\\nfront room of his flat for several days, but no one seemed to want to express\\nanything or move things about the city of Chicago. He then went out to\\nstores, and sought odd jobs delivering heavy boxes to warehouses and\\npicking up loads to be brought back to the stores. In this way, he managed to\\neke out a bare existence, but he thought he was progressing. A chain-store\\nmanager stopped him on the street one day, asked how business was with\\nhim, and said if Jimmy wanted to take over the delivery of groceries for the\\nstore, he could pick up a few dollars a day from making store deliveries. This\\nwas his start. Today he has seven new delivery wagons operating on the\\nsouth side of Chicago, and more on the way. “When that A & P store\\nmanager asked me to make deliveries of gro\\nceries for his customers, he explained that the store was a cash and carry\\nstore, and did not make deliveries,” said Jimmy, “and then he pointed out that\\nthe fellow who was making deliveries up to that time gave poor service.\\n‘There are a few dollars a day in it if you give service,’ the manager told me.\\nI thanked him. A charge of ten cents for each box delivered was added to the\\nstore customer’s bill, and collected at the time the groceries were paid for. All\\nI had to do was stop at the store, put the deliveries on the truck, and deliver\\nthem. But there weren’t many boxes every day. That one store hardly paid for\\nthe gasoline. I lined up another chain store, two independent grocers and\\nthree butchers, however, and made the rounds of each, loaded up the truck\\nand delivered. At the end of each day, the store managers or owners paid me\\nthe amount they had collected, and I was able to carry on.\\n“The most important thing about this type of service was to make frequentdeliveries. Food is wanted quickly. I make four trips to the stores, one at ten,\\none at eleven-thirty, one at two and one at four. I pick up all the boxes and\\npackages of meat and groceries for delivery that are ready, and carry them\\naround. It takes about an hour to make all the deliveries, so that those who\\nbuy at any of the stores on this route have their groceries early enough to start\\nsupper.\\n“When store customers discovered they could depend upon my service, more\\nof them had things delivered. Women hate to carry heavy parcels. Potatoes\\nweigh fifteen pounds to the peck, and no woman wants to carry a peck of\\npotatoes herself. She is glad to have the potatoes and her other groceries\\ncarried for her, and willing to pay a dime for it. In a month, my business had\\nincreased from 40 packages daily from that one neighborhood to 129. In two\\nmonths, I was averaging 150 deliveries a day, and that was about the top. I\\narranged with stores in other communities, got a helper and another second-\\nhand truck. Soon that was booming also.”\\nThere isn’t a small or large town where a good delivery service from stores is\\nnot welcome. Most store people have either discontinued making deliveries,\\nor would be willing to discontinue delivering if there were a local,\\ndependable service such as Overhause offers. Furnishing this type of service\\nis a quick way to get started in a business.\\nSewing for the “Hard-to-Fit” Woman\\nO\\nNE day a Chicago seamstress overheard an extremely stout woman telling a\\nsmall shopkeeper that she experienced so much difficulty in finding suitable\\nclothes in the stores that she had just about given up bothering about her\\nappearance. With an apology, the dressmaker entered the conversation and\\nmade an appointment with the stout woman for a fitting. The stout woman\\nhad a sister of about the same build and she too became a customer. Both of\\nthem knew friends who found difficulty in getting suitable apparel because of\\ntheir size and soon the dressmaker had built up a nice little business.Being an ingenious person, this dressmaker sold her customers on having\\ntheir lingerie as well as their dresses made to order. She also encouraged\\nthem to plan their needs for each season in advance, thus showing them how\\nto be well-dressed with a minimum of expense and time. This plan not only\\nhelped her to organize her work, but also gave her extra work to do in fixing\\nover last season’s dresses for her customers.\\nShe realized that unless she had ideas to offer her customers she would not be\\nable to plan their wardrobe, and she knew that was the secret of success in\\nthis business. So she scanned the pattern books, looked at the new fabrics in\\nthe better department stores, and also looked over the dresses sold by the\\n“stylish stout departments” in these stores. She brought samples of fabrics\\nhome from the stores and mounted them on cards with the prices listed\\nbeneath. Pictures of dresses made from patterns that she thought would make\\nup well for stout figures were also mounted on cards. Customers came to rely\\nmore and more on her judgment as to style and good taste, which, of course,\\nmade the work much easier for her to handle.\\nWhile most of this dressmaker’s work came to her through customers’\\nrecommendations, some of it also came through a corsetiere who had a\\nnumber of stout women on her customer list. An agreement was made\\nbetween the two women to recommend each other to their customers—a plan\\nthat worked to their mutual benefit.\\nRecently, she found another “market” making clothes for unusually tall\\nwomen. These women, like stout women, find it hard to be fitted in\\nreadymade things and to make it more difficult, there are no special\\ndepartments in the stores which cater to their needs. Tall women need longer\\nsleeves, longer skirts, and often longer waists than the average figure\\nrequires, so practically everything they buy has to be altered. This business\\nwas a little harder to build up but it is slowly increasing, mostly through\\n“word-ofmouth” advertising by satisfied customers.\\nAn Airplane Junk Yard\\nARIGO BALBONI , a young California pilot, finds little competition in his\\nline of business, which is salvaging wrecked airplanes. His market for parts\\nof wrecked planes includes movie directors who can use battered planes in\\nfilming crashes, owners of obsolete engines who need repair parts, aviation\\nschools, amateur plane and glider builders, inventors and souvenir hunters.\\nThe idea for his airplane junk yard, just outside of Los Angeles, was the\\nresult of an airplane crash. On a flight one day from San Francisco to Santa\\nMonica, he crashed just north of Los Angeles. He escaped serious injury, but\\nhis plane was completely wrecked. With it went his savings which had been\\ninvested in the plane. He later salvaged what he could of the plane and sold\\nthe parts to aviators. By selling his wrecked plane in this way, he got together\\n$930. It was then that he realized that an airplane junk yard might be a\\nprofitable business. And so it turned out to be. It was not long before he was\\nknown far and wide as a source of supply for airplane parts, and orders began\\ncoming from foreign countries as well as the United States. Aviation schools\\nabroad use the old engines salvaged from the ships to teach the students the\\nmechanics of flying. Inventors buy them and tear them down hoping to find a\\nbetter way of building engines. The instruments and mechanical devices are\\nalso used for this purpose. In order to keep his supply complete, Mr. Balboni\\nis on the alert for news of airplane crashes. Instantly, he takes steps to salvage\\nthe parts and buys them direct from the pilot or others interested.\\nA Business in Organizing ArcheryClubs\\nI\\nN 1929 , J. M. Deeds was a business man in the Northwest with seventy\\npeople on his pay roll. In 1931, he was a common laborer in Oakland,\\nCalifornia. Digging ditches was arduous labor for an aging man in poor\\nhealth; but when one has a wife and children . . .\\nThe following year Mr. Deeds, without work or money, told a minister: “I’ll\\neither have to take up a hobby or go crazy.” The minister replied: “Good idea\\n—the hobby I mean.”Mr. Deeds chose archery because his son and daughter were Scouts and\\nbecause half a century ago as a small boy in the wilds of northern California,\\nhe had been taught by the Indians how to make bows and arrows from the\\nnative woods and how to shoot.\\nBy autumn, 1932, he had become a committee man for the Scouts and had\\nconverted 60 per cent of the members over to the idea of archery as a project.\\nThe following spring saw his interest so intense that he had committed\\nhimself to the pastime as a lifework with the goal of making the East Bay\\nDistrict the archery center of America.\\nThat summer, while conducting a Scout expedition, he came across some\\nexceedingly tough grass which he thought had target possibilities. He mailed\\na sample to the Department of Agriculture, at Washington, and learned that it\\nwas the toughest grass in the United States. The owner of the property on\\nwhich it grew gave Mr. Deeds permission to take all he wanted. He said it\\nwas called wild lyme grass and was useless for hay. Mr. Deeds made a trial\\ntarget and found it more practical than any he had ever used. He cut and\\nhauled away a ton of the grass and in his spare time made targets. These he\\ntraded to tackle makers for raw material which he made into tackle (bows and\\narrows).\\nIn the meantime, he had organized a club called Berkeley Archers and was\\nknown as its guiding genius. There were sixty members—teachers and the\\ntired-business-man element of the East Bay; also a junior section of thirty\\nboys and girls. In addition, there were fifteen men calling themselves “The\\nRovers,” whom he was training for big game hunting.\\nWhen the Federal Emergency Educational Program provided for recreational\\nactivities, Mr. Deeds visited the directors but was turned down; they\\nconsidered archery unsafe. He kept on visiting them until they agreed to\\nexperiment if he could furnish tackle for the class. He could. Hadn’t he been\\nfashioning dozens of bows and hundreds of arrows for just such a\\ncontingency?\\nFive hundred enrolled during the next six months and in two thousandstudent hours not one accident has occurred. Of the group, seventy have\\njoined archery clubs, many securing their tackle from Mr. Deeds.\\nHe learned how to make tackle by trial and error and by winning the\\nfriendship of expert bow makers, one an Indian chief who winters in\\nCalifornia, and the other a leading craftsman of the West. Today Mr. Deeds’\\nbows combine beauty with sturdiness, and a fifteen-pound practice bow of\\nhis devising has proved far better for the novice than the customary twenty-\\nfive or thirty-pound bow.\\nMr. Deeds attributes his enviable reputation as a teacher to the fact that he\\ntakes the mystery out of archery and puts it on a purely mechanical basis. It is\\nhis constant delight to see stooping, pallid men, women and children\\ntransformed into healthy individuals with sparkling eyes and erect carriage.\\nHis hobby has meant the support of his family and the accumulation of tackle\\nworth a thousand dollars. But, best of all, it has meant his personal\\nrehabilitation.\\nGhost Writing Is a Business\\nB\\nACK in February, 1933, when Fred E. Baer, of New York City, realized his\\npublicity business was dying on its feet, he let it expire and he and Henry F.\\nWoods organized the Ghost Writers’ Bureau. What does a Ghost Writers’\\nBureau do? Well, if you are called upon to say something or to write a paper\\nfor your association you get in touch with the Bureau and presto! Your\\nspeech or paper is all prepared for you. Professional and business people use\\nthe service. Many general agents of insurance companies who must prepare\\ninspirational material for salesmen, make constant use of the Bureau’s\\nservices.\\nWhen the Bureau was first organized, the charges for the service ranged from\\nfour to eleven cents a word. This was too high, but it was some time before\\nthe owners realized it. The charge now is one and onehalf to six cents. Part ofthe amount charged goes to the writer; the rest is the Bureau’s compensation.\\nThere are now more than 200 writing specialists on the staff—specialists in\\nscience, architecture, finance, engineering, merchandising, and several other\\nfields. About 1,200 calls for help on speeches, books, articles, and reports\\ncome through the Bureau in a year.\\nAs people don’t like to admit they employ specialists to do their writing for\\nthem, there is little chance of “word of mouth” advertising. Consequently, the\\nBureau has been advertised almost every week from the start through a one-\\ninch advertisement in the New York newspapers.\\nA bureau of this sort could be organized by any alert young business man or\\nwoman with an idea of the needs in his particular community. People active\\nin trade associations, professional clubs, social clubs, women’s clubs, literary\\nclubs, scientific organizations—all need the help of a trained writer in the\\npreparation of manuscripts for publication or the preparation of speeches. The\\nbackbone of an organization, such as this, is a good staff of associates who\\nare experts in their particular fields. There are any number of able writers\\nwho would welcome the chance to make a few extra dollars in their spare\\ntime.\\nSnapshotsPayVacationBills\\nY\\nEARS ago, Robert E. Hughes, a teacher in a high school in one of Chicago’s\\nsuburbs, started taking pictures with a little, inexpensive Brownie. As time\\nwent on he became more and more interested in his hobby and invested in a\\nbetter camera. During his long summer vacations, he carried his camera with\\nhim. One day after he had developed some pictures taken around a boys’\\ncamp, he showed them to the camp director. As a result, he got orders for 200\\npictures. From that time on, he paid for his vacations with the sale of\\nsnapshots. Summer hotels, camps, railroads, tourist agencies, inns, dude\\nranches, clubs, all offered a market. He made the pictures sell themselves. He\\nfigured—and rightly—that if he asked if pictures were wanted, the responsewould be negative.\\nMr. Hughes has found some unusual outlets for snapshots. During one\\nvacation spent in the West and Southwest, he made pictures to order for a\\nlecturer and then developed them for colored slides. Another time he was\\ncommissioned by a travel agency to “shoot” some pictures in Wisconsin. Out\\nof this commission he grossed $2,500. From time to time he has prepared\\nillustrations for advertising booklets. A furnace company not long ago had\\nhim shoot pictures of registers in floors and ceilings at unusual angles.\\nThere is considerable fun to be had out of this hobby also. One picture he\\nenjoyed doing was for a fisherman who had caught an average-sized fish. He\\nmade a picture of the fisherman holding the fish. Then Mr. Hughes was\\ninstructed to “blow up” the fish only—that is, to make the fish so large it\\nwould literally drag on the ground. At the same time, the figure of the\\nfisherman was to be kept to its original size. Needless to say, the fisherman\\nhad plenty of fun over this picture with his fishing cronies. Most summer\\nresorts are eager to obtain post cards of guests who have caught fish or game,\\nand will order quantities of them to sell at the desk, or to use in their\\nadvertising.\\nMr. Hughes develops and finishes all his pictures himself. Thus he can secure\\nthe effects he wants, and he can make various experiments with the\\nnegatives. He has also been able to learn considerably more about taking\\npictures than he would if they had been developed by someone else. He has\\nacquired the knack of reproducing old pictures, such as daguerreotypes, and\\nhas saved many a valued old picture from oblivion. There is simply no end to\\nways of making money from snapshots once you have mastered the knack of\\ntaking pictures of people in action.\\nStyle Scouting with a Camera\\nM\\nANUFACTURERS in the textile field are constantly seeking ideas and\\n“motifs” that can be used in new designs. They pay liberally for photographs—in some cases as much as $l,000—that suggest unusual style themes.\\nMarion Stephenson, of New York, was aware of this but never suspected that\\nstyle scouting had business possibilities until she sold her first photograph to\\na New York silk company. Inside of three months she was making good\\nmoney, and was going all over the world with her camera looking for unusual\\n“shots” which might suggest interesting or unusual style motifs to designers.\\n“I went to France, England, Germany and Italy,” said Miss Stephenson,\\n“where I hunted out gatherings of smart people, and snapped moving pictures\\nand stills of them for style notes to help manufacturers plan new lines. It is\\ninteresting work, and there is an ever-widening field for it. I pay my own\\nexpenses, but there is enough profit from this specialized work to make it\\nworth while. Style scouting isn’t difficult. I don’t know exactly how to tell\\nanyone how to go about it because there are no definite rules to follow.\\nHowever, I believe that any woman who loves clothes and is observant could\\ndo well as a style scout. In my work, I use photographs because I am not an\\nartist and cannot make sketches. A woman with a sense of line and color,\\nwho can sketch a little, should be able to get more feeling in design than I am\\nable to and could soon earn a nice income.”\\nAny concern dependent upon style is a prospect for such pictures and is\\nconstantly on the alert for suggestions. As special training is not required for\\nthis type of work, the girl who is observant and anxious to get started in an\\ninteresting and profitable profession, might well consider style scouting.\\nWalkingtheDog\\nA\\nPROFITABLE business has been developed in New York by a group of\\nenterprising young men who call themselves the “dog-walkers.” The only\\ncapital necessary consists of proper clothing for the season, good legs, and a\\nlove of dogs. The dog-walkers are to be seen on upper Fifth and Park\\nAvenues and in Central Park, giving their pedigreed charges an airing.\\nThis service is appreciated by elderly people who like the companionship ofdogs but do not have the energy to give them long walks; by invalids, and by\\nbusiness people who cannot find time regularly for this duty. In Chicago,\\nanother group has also developed a dog-walking, dog-washing and dog-\\nclipping service for busy dog owners.\\nAnother service for dogs, developed in New York, is what is called the\\n“Puppy Club.” The Park Lane Hotel inaugurated the “Puppy Club,” which is\\nlocated on the roof. Here dogs may lunch, snooze, play or be groomed while\\ntheir owners have their luncheon in the hotel dining room. The pup’s owner\\nmay leave him all afternoon, if he wishes, to sun himself. An expert\\nveterinary prescribes diet and treatments. The space used for the purpose is so\\nlocated that it is suitable for nothing else and the equipment and decorations\\nare both inexpensive. The idea has not only brought in money for otherwise\\nwasted space, but it keeps the canine pets of hotel guests and visitors out of\\nthe hotel proper.\\nWhat One Man Did with an Old Truck\\nS\\nEVERAL years ago the company that employed him failed and James\\nBradley was out of a job. In the small town of Ft. Atkinson, Wisconsin, there\\nwere none too many jobs and he found it more difficult every day to get\\nsomething to do. From time to time, of course, he would pick up a little job\\nhere and there, but nothing that was permanent.\\nOne day he was walking around his little place trying to decide what to do,\\nwhen he happened to glance at an old truck chassis in his garage. Perhaps he\\ncould get some work trucking if he could fix the old machine up, was his\\nthought. A junk yard a few blocks away furnished the material for a body and\\nwhen it was put on the truck and painted, James Bradley was ready for work.\\nBusiness was hard to get at first. Both he and his wife kept eyes and ears\\nopen for any possible chances of trucking jobs. The first job was hauling the\\nhousehold goods of a local resident who was moving to Milwaukee. Another\\nsimilar job in a near-by town turned up, and gradually he found himselfpicking up odd jobs here and there that the large trucking companies would\\nnot bother to handle. In a short time, James Bradley had a fleet of trucks, had\\nthe franchise for all the trucking on the route to Milwaukee, and had several\\nspecial contracts to handle the hauling of various companies. One of these\\ncompanies was Republic Steel of Milwaukee. Arrangements have also been\\nmade with other trucking companies all over the country to connect with their\\nshipments at specific points in the territory which he covers.\\nTrader’s Exchange Does a National Business\\nT\\nHE Trader’s Exchange, an agency for national barter, only a few years old,\\nbecame one of the largest swapping agencies in the country. Mr. Savino\\nMorizzo, who runs it, claims that he handles $500,000 in goods annually and\\nhas taken in as many as 4,500 items in a month. Around 36,000 letters pass\\nthrough his hands each month and he will handle the swapping of anything\\nunder the sun—merchandise, farm produce, livestock, pets, etc.\\nThe story goes, that a student in Alabama who had a saxophone wanted a\\nmicroscope; a widow living in Arizona had a microscope but wanted some\\npigs, and a farmer in Oklahoma, who had six baby pigs, wanted a saxophone.\\nThe Trader’s Exchange put the farmer, the widow, and the student in touch\\nwith one another, the exchange was made all around, and everyone was\\nsatisfied. Some of the strangest trades have been six grey squirrels for a\\nvacuum cleaner; 49 shaving brushes and a marble slab for a coupe; and a set\\nof castanets, a Spanish comb and a fancy costume for a course of six beauty\\ntreatments.\\nWhile this exchange has a national set-up and is in a position to make\\nconsiderable money through the large volume of business done, there is an\\nexcellent opportunity in many a small town for a similar exchange which\\ncould operate more or less locally. An inexpensive store, your own home, or\\nspace in another store, could be used for the purpose. Handbills and local\\nnewspaper advertising will bring you requests for items or will put you in\\ntouch with people who have things to sell. Once your store becomes knownaround the countryside, your clientele will naturally develop through word-\\nof-mouth advertising. At a period like the present, when money is scarce,\\nswapping is in high favor.\\nBoys’ Club Proves Profitable\\nJ\\nOHN BANCROFT had been quite an athlete in college. He found it difficult\\nto get the sort of work he wanted after he left school, so he made a job for\\nhimself which not only paid him well but filled a community need. He started\\na club of boys interested in athletics. He calls it the “Springfield Boys’ Club,”\\nand divides the boys into two groups. The first group is composed of boys\\neight years old or younger. It meets after school two days each week and on\\nSaturday mornings. The second group of boys from nine to fourteen years of\\nage meets three afternoons each week. The charge for each boy varies from\\n$3.50 to $5.00 a month and with from twenty to twenty-five boys in each\\ngroup, John Bancroft’s income runs well over $1,000 a year. Out of this\\namount he pays such expenses as the fee for the use of a swimming pool, the\\nsalary of an assistant, the operation of a “caddy wagon,” and other\\nincidentals.\\nThe club is a year-round affair and is divided into two semesters: the spring-\\nsummer term and the fall-winter term. The athletic activities vary according\\nto the season and include baseball, football, swimming, boxing, hiking,\\nrowing and gymnasium work. Special arrangements are made with one of the\\nlocal hotels for the use of the swimming pool during periods when it is too\\ncold for the lake. Of course, during the swimming season, the boys are taken\\nto the beach for their swimming lessons. On rainy days, the boys are\\ninstructed in making such things as kites and toy airplanes which they are\\nlater taught to fly. From time to time, John Bancroft or his assistant takes the\\nboys on all-night hikes or hikes over the week-end in order that they may\\nlearn something about woodcraft. A caddy wagon—a truck fitted with seats\\n—is used to transport the boys to the various locations where they are to play.\\nAt the end of the term he holds an athletic event at the hotel swimming pooland all the boys’ parents and friends are invited to attend. Even the little\\nfellows are entered in the boxing contests and their skill is always a surprise\\nto the spectators. Naturally, this exhibit has a promotional value and results in\\nadded names to the roster of the Boys’ Club.\\nThis is an activity which any young man residing in a fairly prosperous\\ncommunity can undertake if he has had some athletic training and knows how\\nto handle groups of boys. Young women can also handle similar groups of\\ngirls. In this case, the athletic training would be in such sports as swimming,\\ndiving, tennis, basket-ball, hiking and skating.\\nMeals for Dogs Is a Business Now\\nA\\nWIDE-AWAKE woman in New York has built up an unusual business\\npreparing meals for dog owners who do not have the time or do not want to\\nbother preparing food for their pets. This daily service to dog owners is\\noperated under the name of the Canine Catering Company. The business has\\ngrown so rapidly that branches have been established in a half dozen near-by\\ntowns as well as offices in Philadelphia and Washington. Businesses of this\\nnature have also thrived in Chicago and Los Angeles.\\nA business such as this can only be started in a community where there are\\nplenty of pure-bred dogs, whose owners have money enough not only to\\npurchase such dogs but to care for them properly. It naturally follows that\\nyou must know something about diets for dogs, the quantity necessary for\\ndaily feedings for the various breeds, and the costs of the foods that go into\\nthe preparation of the meals. However, this information can be secured from\\nany good book on the care of dogs.\\nThe only investment required is a light delivery truck which can be purchased\\nsecond hand for a few hundred dollars, and paid for on time. The rate being\\ncharged for medium-sized breeds such as Airedales and Chows is 22 cents\\nfor one diet and 20 cents for a second. On Friday each dog is served a fish\\ndiet for which a charge of 14 cents is made. Meals for the smaller breeds suchas Boston and Cairn Terriers are priced at 14 cents; Pekingese, 10 cents, and\\nScotties, Sealyhams and Wire Haired Terriers, 18 cents. A specimen meal for\\nthe day for an Airedale consists of raw or cooked lean beef which is cubed or\\nground, string beans, or other greens and zwieback.\\nHow to Start a Postal Card AdvertisingService\\nA\\nDAM K. ANDERSON, an accountant in Salt Lake City, happened to come\\ninto a certain modernly equipped butcher shop when one of the partners was\\ngreeting a customer.\\n“How do you do, Mrs. Smith,” he said. “I haven’t seen you for more than six\\nmonths. Have you moved away?”\\n“No,” she answered. “I still live at the same place, but it was a couple of\\nblocks closer to go down the street the opposite direction and I just got into\\nthe habit of buying my meats there.”\\n“I do hope you will come back and trade with us now,” the butcher\\ncontinued. “We certainly appreciate your business.”\\n“Think I will,” she said. “Everything seems to look so nice here and you\\nalways took good care of our meat requirements. We’re having company\\ntomorrow evening and I’ll telephone you what I will need. Give me a small\\nsirloin for tonight.”\\nThus an old customer was easily won back. It reminded Anderson that just a\\nmonth ago he received a postal card from a local clothier which had caused\\nhim to buy an Easter suit at a store which he had not patronized for several\\nyears. The card was very simple. A little bar of music was reproduced\\nroughly across the top. It was a couple of measures from the verse, “Should\\nAuld Acquaintance Be Forgot.” Brief wording on the card said the\\nmanagement had missed his patronage, that his business was appreciated, and\\nthat they hoped he would be in to buy an Easter suit. If winning back old\\ncustomers was that easy, he thought, why didn’t more merchants take steps to\\ngo after old customers?\\nMr. Anderson talked it over with the butcher and explained about the postal\\ncard idea. He found out that the butcher had recently counted the oldaccounts on the books which had showed no entries for the past couple of\\nmonths and the total, nearly six hundred, startled him. Anderson left the shop\\ndetermined to find out how those postals were produced.\\nThe next day he learned there were several different duplicating and\\naddressing machines for handling postal card advertising and that these small\\nmachines were available for as low as thirty-five dollars. A salesman selling\\none of the machines became interested in the idea and gave him several\\nsamples of postal cards produced on his machine for advertising purposes.\\nAnderson was satisfied that here was a means for making money during his\\nforced vacation of one month without pay in a dull season. He took the\\nsample cards to the butcher. The butcher ordered a series of three to be sent to\\nold customers at monthly intervals. Then, he went to the druggist who had a\\nlarger list, and secured an order for cards to old customers who had stopped\\nbuying and another lot to present customers featuring some new special\\nitems. Next, a dry cleaner saw the possibilities of using the card idea. Soon\\nAnderson had sold small jobs totaling over $2,500, to the upholstering shop,\\nmusic store, paint store, lumber yard, and many other types of merchants and\\nsmall manufacturing plants all around the city. He paid for the machine the\\nfirst two weeks. His ink and supplies amounted to comparatively little. His\\nbiggest cost was the postal cards costing a cent each at the post office, which,\\nfor the period, totaled less than $9.50. He was quick to offer ideas to the\\nmerchants and for that reason got a little higher price for the work which\\nincluded writing up the cards for each case. The first month showed a nice\\nprofit; the second month with the aid of his son, who had just graduated from\\nhigh school, he handled the remaining orders that had been obtained. By the\\ntime the third month had rolled around the total profit was sufficient to buy\\nlarger equipment and to set up his son in a small business.\\nBringing the Show to the Audience\\nW\\nHEN the carnival to which he was attached disbanded, J. E. Cox found\\nhimself in a small town in Georgia. Forced to remain there for several days,\\nhe studied this town carefully. Its population was less than one hundred. Ithad no entertainment facilities. It was drab and colorless, yet as he looked it\\nover, Cox hit upon an idea that since has brought him profits enough to cause\\nthe mouth of any big city theater man to water. Cox’s idea was patterned after\\nthat which brought prosperity to owners of showboats in the old river days.\\nHe brought a show to people in the hinterland, miles from the railroads. But\\nhe didn’t bring a troupe of players. He brought talking motion pictures\\ninstead.\\nHe went down to Atlanta and bought a portable sound projecting unit,\\ndipping into an old-fashioned money bag for the $300 to pay for it, and put\\nthe unit in his second-hand truck. With the equipment, he was given a\\nportable screen and a 1,000-foot film, entitled the “Battle,” which he used\\nwhen he put on his first show the following night in a town one hundred\\nmiles from Atlanta. He rented a schoolroom for this first performance and\\ninvited the town to attend. They turned out in force, and many in this\\naudience were listening to a talkie for the first time. He traveled to the next\\ntown the day following, and again rented a schoolroom, crowding in 175\\ncustomers to each of two performances. Cox charged an admission fee of 15\\ncents in both towns, and decided to maintain that fee as a fixed policy. At the\\nend of the first week his profits were $104.50, so he decided to get a better\\nfilm to show in a town of 1,600 population on his schedule for the following\\nSaturday. This new film featuring a musical comedy was ordered shipped to\\nthat town and was there when he arrived. There was a larger attendance in\\nthis town than in the others. People came in from the hills to see it and he\\nstayed there for four days. This proved so profitable that he abandoned one-\\nnight stands, and now makes two stops weekly. Before leaving one small\\ntown, he makes an early morning trip to the next town on his schedule,\\nstopping along the way to post announcements on trees, fences, and barns\\ntelling where his next show will be given, thus assuring himself of a good\\naudience. His average weekly expenses have been running about $62.00 and\\nhis profits generally a little better than $150.00 a week—a tidy little income.\\nCox’s idea may profitably be carried out in many parts of the country, where\\nthe towns and villages are some distance removed from railroads and cities.\\nThere are even communities of 2,000 population which do not have a motion\\npicture theater. Cox does not rent first or second run films, but buys oldnumbers and uses them over and over again at a small cost for each\\nperformance.\\nTrucking Fruit from Florida\\nA\\nTRUCK farmer living near Menominee, Michigan, found the going rather\\nhard during the depression, and in trying to find ways and means of\\nbolstering up the family income, hit upon the idea of trucking fruit. The truck\\nhe had been using to transport his garden produce was now standing idle\\nmost of the time. His eldest son was also idle, having been unable to find any\\nwork since he had finished high school. The truck and the boy were\\naccordingly dispatched to Florida to buy citrus fruits, and when the truck\\nreturned loaded with fruit, he sold out all of it within a few days.\\nUntil now, tropical fruits had been high in Menominee. Now that he could\\nsell them a little cheaper, the public bought him out each time the truck\\nreturned from a trip. Before long he had four trucks running between Florida\\nand Menominee to supply the demand for fresh fruits. In addition, he opened\\nfour stores to handle the produce brought in by his trucks. Two of these stores\\nare in Menominee, and two in Marinette, Wisconsin, which is just across the\\nriver. His market, which takes in these two towns and the surrounding\\nterritory, includes about 35,000 population.\\nHow Money Can Be Made in Cemeteries\\nD\\nURING an automobile trip from his home in Kansas City to a near-by town,\\nArthur T. Ruggles noticed several run-down cemeteries. “Here,” thought\\nRuggles, “is an opportunity to make some money.” So he went to see the key\\nman on the board who had charge of one of the cemeteries.\\nThis man was frank to admit the cemetery was in sad need of having theedges of the drives cleaned up, removing the ruts from the roadways,\\nremoving the brush from various spots where lots were unsold, leveling the\\nland in locations where it was rough, planting grass seed, and similar work\\nwhich the keeper was unable to do. He said it was difficult to keep lot owners\\nsatisfied and to sell additional lots with the cemetery in such a condition.\\nThen the real obstacle came to light. There is always some obstacle to be\\nhurdled. The board member said they just did not have the money to get this\\nextra work done. But Mr. Ruggles was not to be stopped by this hurdle. This\\nalibi about not having the money is an ancient one. He thought for a moment.\\nThen an idea came to him. He told the board member that he might take\\ncemetery lots in payment for the job. The board member jumped at the\\nopportunity.\\nSo a deal was made. The arrangement was that Ruggles was to receive\\ncemetery lots valued at $2,000 for the work specified. He hired a couple of\\ngardeners to help him do the work. In the meantime, he employed a salesman\\non a commission arrangement to help him sell the lots.\\nMr. Ruggles knew that the psychological time to sell the lots was when the\\nwork was progressing on the improvements. Before the job was finished, the\\nlots had been sold. The labor and materials for the job actually came to less\\nthan $500. The salesman’s commissions totaled $500. This left Ruggles with\\nan actual profit of about $1,000 on the deal.\\nIt was a deal that made everyone concerned satisfied and happy. Mr. Ruggles\\nthen started a more ambitious plan to make the same deal with cemetery\\ncompanies in other localities, with the result that he is now at the head of a\\nthriving and prosperous business, netting him several thousand dollars a year.\\nTurning Ashes into Gold\\nJ\\nOHN TOWNS , assayer, owner of the Maryland Smelting & Refining\\nCompany, San Antonio, Texas, struck gold right in the heart of the city! Itwas like this: One day, while Mr. Towns chanced to be watching the\\njanitor of a local building, which housed a number of dentists, carting away\\nashes from the building’s incinerator, a sudden idea came to him. “Give me a\\nsample of those ashes,” he remarked. He took the ashes to his office and\\nassayed them. He discovered that the sample contained enough gold to\\naverage $140 worth of gold to the ton!\\nSo his hunch was right. Dentists work with gold; filing, scraping and molding\\nit. Naturally, tiny particles of gold fell to the floor and were swept up, finally\\nending up in the ashes of the incinerator. He contracted to buy the sweepings\\nfrom this building.\\nThus began one of America’s strangest businesses, and one of the most\\nprofitable in consideration of the investment required. Beginning in San\\nAntonio, Mr. Towns rapidly expanded his purchases. He bought sweepings\\nfrom medical office buildings in Dallas, Fort Worth and Houston, one Dallas\\nbuilding’s sweepings assaying $700 worth of gold to the ton.\\nToday Mr. Towns buys sweepings from medical office buildings in thirty\\ndifferent states. He receives about ten tons of ashes and sweepings per month,\\nwith the assay running all the way from a little better than $100 to $2,000 per\\nton. Yet the famed Juneau gold mine of Alaska is being operated successfully\\nwith an assay of only fifty cents worth of gold per ton.\\nNaturally, this is a specialized business, requiring special skill and\\nknowledge. Not everyone could do it, of course. It does show, however, the\\nburied opportunities that lie all about you, if you will keep your eyes and\\nmind open for them!\\nAClubTruckGarden\\nA\\nTRUCK farmer in New York State had been raising garden truck for several\\nyears and peddling it house to house. For some time he had been dissatisfiedwith the small returns on his labor but he didn’t seem to be able to find a way\\nout of his difficulties. One evening as he stood looking out over his farm\\npondering how his customers and his crops could be brought together in a\\nmore lucrative manner, he hit upon the idea of organizing a group of people\\nand planting their gardens for them. His family at first thought the idea\\nimpossible, but he went ahead with building up his club and soon he had\\norganized a group of one hundred members.\\nEach member may select the vegetables he wants—peas, sweet corn, carrots,\\nradishes, lettuce, and other vegetables—and the truck farmer plants them on\\nhis place. The charge for planting, cultivating and fertilizing the vegetables is\\n$1.00 a row. The members have the pleasure of driving out to the farm\\nwhenever they wish to select and gather their own vegetables. Nine times out\\nof ten, when they depart with their cars filled with vegetables, they have\\nsome honey, butter, or eggs packed away in the car, too. The farmer is clever\\nenough not only to get them to come to him for their vegetables, but while\\nthey are on the spot, he sells them some of the products from which he gets a\\ngood cash income.\\nPlanning “Little Dinners” for Restaurants\\nH\\nELEN EWING , living in the city of Chicago, was just one of the many\\nthousands of women rated as good cooks. Not long ago she became\\nacquainted with the wife of a restaurant owner, who one day remarked about\\nthe difference in home and restaurant cooking. “If someone could only get\\nmy husband to make up a more varied menu,” said this friend, “he would\\nprobably be able to keep his customers. So many people stop coming because\\nthey say that the menu is monotonous.” Later, upon hearing about a\\nsuccessful restaurant operator in California, who attributed his success to the\\ngreat variety of dishes he served, Miss Ewing decided to look into the subject\\nof menus.\\n“After going around to many restaurants and examining the menus, I\\ndiscovered that restaurant men wanted to be relieved from making up theirown menus,” stated Miss Ewing. “I also found that they needed variety in\\ntheir menus—something fresh and different daily which would revive interest\\nin their dinners. At the same time it occurred to me that the secret of keeping\\nflavor and appeal in food was to cook it in smaller quantities. This is the only\\nway that chefs can get that ‘home-cooking’ flavor. So I made up what I call a\\nseries of little dinners and submitted them to several restaurant proprietors.\\nThey considered them and then agreed to use them. That’s how I got started\\non my present career.”\\nMiss Ewing opened an office in a Chicago “Loop” office building and began\\nselling little luncheon menus to Chicago restaurant proprietors. She called\\nthis unusual business a “Planning Service,” and charged a flat rate of $5.00 a\\nmonth for it. In less than a year, she secured subscriptions to this service from\\nnearly two hundred restaurants, and her profits began to add up to a tidy sum.\\nShe did what thousands of women have the ability and qualifications to do:\\nplanned simple, inexpensive meals. A similar service might be profitably\\nstarted in other cities, inasmuch as there are thousands of small restaurant\\nproprietors who lack the imagination to plan a wellbalanced and varied menu\\nthemselves. In making up the menu for a small luncheon which retails say,\\nfor 25 or 30 cents, it is well to bear in mind that the restaurant must secure a\\nminimum of twice the retail cost of each food item served, in order to make a\\nprofit. Thus a 25-cent meal should cost the restaurant not more than 12½\\ncents. Recipes showing the proper amount of each food offered should be\\nsubmitted daily with this service, the same recipes being sent to each chef\\nusing them. It is not necessary to invest much money in a service of this\\nnature. Simply prepare the first menu, have it mimeographed, and mail copies\\nto each subscriber. In preparing these menus always keep in mind the\\nseasonal changes in foods.\\nA “Fix-lt” Shop on Wheels\\nF\\nOR fifty years, George Burley, of Des Moines, Iowa, who is now seventy-\\nseven years old, has made a good living fixing things that others can’t. Hisslogan is “If Burley can’t fix it, throw it away.” In his little shop which is at\\nthe back of his home he repairs furniture, picture frames, replaces broken\\nglass in mirrors or pictures, re-silvers mirrors, paints old furniture with great\\nskill, mends china, repairs broken dolls, re-canes broken seats or backs of\\nchairs, restores the finish on old furniture, polishes silver and brass, cuts glass\\nto any required size, repairs enameled signs, repairs pottery, cleans leather\\nsaddles and other leather goods, cleans rust from metal objects and\\ninstruments, cleans and mends ivory objects, sharpens knives and lawn\\nmower blades, and repairs many other things the average person lacks skill to\\nhandle.\\nPeople have come to have perfect confidence in him and will entrust some of\\ntheir most prized possessions to his skillful hands. It has taken time, of\\ncourse, to build up this confidence and its resulting list of steady customers.\\nHe secured the needed formulas for use in this work by reference to standard\\nbooks in the field such as Henley’s Twentieth Century Book of Recipes,\\nFormulas & Processes. Additional money is made by the preparation and\\nsale to customers of an excellent furniture polish. In preparing this polish he\\ndid not try to compete with any of the cheaper polishes on the market, but\\nmade a high-priced product which brings him a good profit on each bottle.\\nMost of his work is done in his own shop where he has the proper equipment\\nand tools to handle almost any kind of repair job. However, in some cases the\\nwork is of such a nature it has to be handled in the customer’s home.\\nIn Philadelphia the “fix-it” business has been developed by one man to a\\npoint where he requires a fleet of Ford trucks to “patrol” the city. If a\\nhousewife has a leaky faucet, or her electric iron goes on the “fritz,” instead\\nof sending for a plumber or an electrician who would probably charge two or\\nthree dollars to fix it, she calls “Mr. Fix-It.” Within an hour the “Fix-It” truck\\nrolls up to the door and in a few minutes the repair has been made. The\\nsuccess of this venture lies in the fact that each truck carries a complete\\nassortment of repair parts for fixing almost anything that can go wrong in a\\nhouse, and using the block system to speed up service. Truck drivers are\\nrequired to keep in telephone communication with a “dispatcher” at\\nheadquarters. As each call comes in, it is put on file, and when the drivertelephones he is given a list of all calls on file in his district. This makes it\\npossible to give rapid-fire service and low prices to the customer. Since the\\nneeded repairs and tools are in the truck, and not in some plumber’s or\\nelectrician’s shop a mile or more away, the usual excessive charge for going\\nback after tools and repair parts is avoided.\\nThere is no reason why there should not be a “Fix-It” truck in every city. All\\nthat is needed to start such a business is some knowledge of home appliances\\nand equipment, about $50 for an initial stock of miscellaneous repair parts, a\\nfew special tools such as a reamer for “seating” faucet valves, and a light\\ntruck which can be converted into a “Fix-It” shop on wheels.\\nStarting an Art Academy on a “Shoestring”\\nH\\nAVE you considered that in these days of leisure one of the surest ways to\\nmake money is to help people to use their leisure time to improve their\\nminds? Americans are fast becoming “art conscious.” Business men are\\norganizing art clubs, and women, released from housekeeping drudgery by\\nthe advent of electrical appliances, are going in for music, drama and the\\nother arts. Young people just out of school, finding jobs scarce, are studying\\ndrawing and design. All of which spells opportunity for those who know\\nsomething about art. Best of all you can start an art school with no money\\nwhatever.\\nEleanor Verande had no money at all when she decided to start the New York\\nAcademy of Arts. So she went to the owner of an office building and offered\\na course of instruction in art for his daughter in exchange for office rent.\\nThen she discovered that she needed a stenographer and a clerk, so she\\narranged instruction in art and music for stenographic work.\\nA piano, two large mirrors, easels and a model stand were given to her by a\\nwoman in exchange for her daughter’s painting lessons and the new art\\nacademy was soon on its way. The day it opened, the energetic Miss Verande\\nenrolled several students, and soon had sufficient money to carry her along.“I taught a carpenter how to dance in exchange for a neat job of installing\\npartitions, and because a Polish cook wanted her daughter to be a dancer, I\\narranged to give lessons which were paid by supplying the faculty with\\nmeals,” declared Miss Verande. “There wasn’t a great deal of money in the\\nfirst few months, but trading around as I did, enabled me to get by. About a\\nhundred pupils were enrolled, most of them working out their tuition in one\\nway or other, but a few paid real money. I started this school because I was\\ntired of the stage, and though I had no money, I was determined to start\\nanyway.”\\nThis determined little lady at fifteen was giving imitations of Spinelli,\\nMistingette, and Yvonne Printempts in Paris night clubs. At sixteen she was\\npremiere danseuse of the Lyon Opera. She danced in Ziegfeld’s “Three\\nMusketeers,” appeared in movies as a double for Vilma Banky, and studied\\ndancing with Tarasoff, Kobeleff and Fokine. With this background, Eleanor\\nwas a competent instructress in art, and felt at the time, she needed nothing\\nbut a chance to start.\\nYoung and ambitious people who are determined to do things, may find a\\nway of getting started by applying the barter principle as Miss Verande\\napplied it. If you have no money, start in a business for which you are\\nqualified, using the barter-and-trade idea for capital.\\nCatering to School Children\\nW\\nHEN Mrs. Frank Hartman, who lived in a Chicago suburb, found it difficult\\nto keep the family going comfortably on its diminished income she hit upon\\nthe idea of serving luncheons and dinners to school children. Once she had\\ndecided upon the plan it didn’t take long for the news to get around the\\nneighborhood. Her little girl of nine told the school children and Mrs.\\nHartman told her neighbors, friends, members of her church and club. She\\nfound getting luncheon for a group of youngsters was a lot of fun. The\\nchildren said that the luncheons were like parties and they eagerly looked\\nforward to a day that mother would be going to a bridge luncheon or intoChicago or visiting elsewhere so that they could have luncheon at Mrs.\\nHartman’s with the other youngsters.\\nThe fact that they were served nourishing food was a big point in favor\\nof having the children eat at Mrs. Hartman’s. Instead of the youngsters\\nbuying fifteen cents worth of candy and a ham sandwich or a bowl of soup at\\nsome school store, they paid their twenty-five cents for a well-balanced meal.\\nLuncheons consisted of milk or cocoa, bread in some form, butter, fruit for\\ndessert, homemade cookies or cake and a main course. In winter the main\\ncourse was a hot dish such as baked eggs, baked rice with little pieces of\\nmeat in it, or a baked tomato stuffed with rice or meat. In summer she served\\na vegetable salad with graham bread, or a scooped out tomato filled with\\ncottage cheese, or some other cool dish. The meals were served on a long\\nrefectory table and each dish was daintily prepared and served. Whenever\\npossible, she served dishes in fancy forms such as individual molds of jello,\\nindividual iced cakes, cookies cut in fancy shapes, etc. These little touches\\ndid not mean any more expense but they did entail more work. However, it\\nwas such attention to detail that brought the same children back again and\\nagain. Whenever possible she catered to a child’s particular liking for some\\none food, serving it in turn with some other dish that the other children liked.\\nHer own little girl being at the table made the luncheon group seem like one\\nbig family.\\nHer figures on a meal run about fifteen cents for dessert, twelve to fifteen\\ncents for milk, eight cents for a loaf of bread, twenty cents for the main\\ncourse and about five or six cents for butter. Adding about ten cents to this\\namount for gas consumed, the cost of each meal runs around seventy or\\neighty cents. A group of ten at 25 cents each thus leaves a profit of about\\n$1.50 to $1.75 and the work at the most takes only two hours. As she charges\\n50 cents for dinner, two or three little guests pay for the family dinner and\\nleave a little for profit. Mr. Hartman is a kindly, genial man who enjoys\\nhaving children around and he generally walks home with them after dinner\\nto see that they reach there safely. If the mothers want them to stay for the\\nentire evening until called for, Mrs. Hartman charges 50 cents additional for\\neach child.\\nAt one time she made a list of the names of children’s parents and had hersister type each mother a letter in which she described the various menus\\nserved the children. She also emphasized the fact that the best ingredients\\nwere used in cooking and that the children were served only foods suitable\\nfor young, growing people. A few of these letters were also sent to others she\\nthought might be prospects and resulted in a number of new faces around her\\nluncheon table.\\n“Nickel-in-the-Slot”PoolTables\\nC\\nOIN-OPERATED machines have become a craze in this country. Marvin\\nOwens, for instance, bought three tables, placed them in busy taverns and is\\nwell on the way to making his $1,000. These tables require no attention. They\\nare standard, official billiard tables upon which a regulation pool game may\\nbe played. You simply drop a nickel in the slot, and are then ready to play a\\nfull game of pool. Counters, cues, chalk, and other necessary equipment are\\nfurnished with the table.\\n“I thought when I first saw the illustration of this table that it was\\nanother one of those pool table toys,” Mr. Owens told our editor. “But\\ninvestigation quickly dispelled this idea. The table is a regulation table on\\nwhich you ‘shoot’ a regulation game. The beauty of it is that one or more\\npersons can play for the same price. Many men have an idea they’re pool\\nsharks and, of course, when they see the pool table, they want to prove their\\nskill. The result is a good play wherever a table is set up—especially in\\ntaverns.\\n“I started with three tables. Today I have ten in operation, and collect once\\nevery two weeks. The tables cost me seventy dollars each, and pay me a\\nprofit of about fourteen dollars weekly. I give the tavern owner a commission\\nof 25 per cent. The novelty of a coin-operated pool game appeals to almost\\nevery man who has ever handled a cue. Even people who have not played a\\ngame of pool in years become enthusiasts. More play is given the coin-\\noperated table, therefore, than a regular pool table. The one drawback to\\ncontinued operation of these tables is that when the tavern owner sees howgood a play he gets, he wants to buy the table outright. This has happened\\nseveral times, and while I haven’t as yet sold the tables, I’m figuring on\\nletting the tavern owners have them since the re-sale price of $125 offers a\\ngood profit on each table.”\\nOwens feels there is never a good reason for turning down profit. He declares\\nhis future policy will be to take the profit from operating the machines as\\nlong as possible, and then to sell them to the taverns, insuring himself of a\\ntwo-way profit on his money. The idea is worth considering, if you want to\\nmake money operating this type of coin machine. There are many good\\nlocations in all parts of the country where this table ought to pay since no\\n“gambling” objection may be raised to the machine.\\nTurning a Natural Flair to Profit\\nA\\nPRINCIPLE of business success too often overlooked is striving to do some\\none thing better than anybody else is doing it. This idea is well expressed in\\nthat old saw about the man who can build a better mouse-trap being sought\\nout, however far he may be from the beaten path. Take guns, for instance.\\nYou would hardly think of “gun doctoring” as being a business that would\\nmake money. Guns are such incidental things. Yet Jack Roske, of San\\nFrancisco, has found it highly profitable.\\nIn 1927 while still in high school, Jack Roske used to drop in on a gunsmith\\nbecause he was curious about firearms. Some of his questions were too deep\\nfor the gunsmith (he was an artisan not an oracle) but he was deeply\\nimpressed. The boy was a “natural”! He let Jack help him after school,\\nteaching him many things, and after graduation took him in as an apprentice\\nand kept him until the business failed.\\nRoske then went to punching cattle, but his interest in firearms never flagged\\nand he continued studying about guns past and present. There are few really\\nauthoritative books on the subject of firearms and these, having been printed\\nin limited editions numbering a thousand or less, come high. Some cost fivedollars, some twenty-five, but the gun student gladly sacrificed many\\npleasures in order to possess these books. He joined the National Rifle\\nAssociation and read magazines, catalogs—anything he could find about\\nguns. Eventually he was able to look at any gun and tell you all about it,\\nwhich means something when you consider that there are approximately\\n90,000 types, not counting minor variations.\\nWhen Jack returned to San Francisco, his gunsmith friend was back in\\nbusiness but could give him only part-time work. Anyway, repairing ordinary\\nguns was no kind of job for one with his highly specialized capabilities. His\\ntalent had been molded into an art. But where could he make his services\\nvaluable?\\nThen came the proof that an artist in any line will inevitably find his right\\nplace. Two years ago there opened in San Francisco, a unique establishment\\nknown as the Far West Hobby Shop—a collector’s Mecca. China, pioneer\\nrelics, costume books, and hundreds of things rare and curious are found\\nthere. Its most noteworthy collection, however, is firearms. The shop has the\\nlargest stock of guns on the Pacific Coast—over six hundred and principally\\ncollectors’ items. There are little Derringers, like the one used to assassinate\\nLincoln, big 1836 Pattersons, and the first Colt model; there are ornate\\nFrench dueling pistols in elaborate hand-carved cases, and plain, solid, purely\\nAmerican rifles such as Daniel Boone used to fight off the Indians.\\nThe need was for a gun expert thoroughly familiar with the history and\\noperation of firearms—one who could put into condition old models bought\\nby the shop and tell visitors all about the various guns in stock. A man, in\\nshort, who could take charge of the firearms from the time they entered the\\nshop until they went out. It is a difficult post but Jack Roske fills it to\\nperfection. Being young, handsome and as physically fit as a Zane Grey hero\\nis one more point in his favor.\\nHis native talent, combined with his knowledge acquired through years of\\nstudy and experience, gives him a sixth sense which enables him to take an\\nancient, incomplete model to pieces, fabricate the missing parts, and\\nreassemble the whole with no guide or precedent.He says it’s like learning shorthand. “You keep on working and practicing\\nuntil it becomes second nature.” His four years of mechanical drawing and\\ntwo years of woodworking crafts have, no doubt, helped him considerably.\\nHow to Get the Doctor\\nI\\nF YOU will look in the classified section of your local telephone directory,\\nyou will probably see at least one “Telephone Secretarial Service” listed.\\nThese telephone services have developed during the last few years because of\\nthe demand by doctors and other professional men and women for a\\ntelephone arrangement which automatically takes incoming calls when the\\nsubscriber is out of his office.\\nFor instance, if you should call Dr. Brown and he is out on an “emergency\\ncall” there may be no way to get in touch with him unless his family can\\nmanage to handle calls for him. However, if he has subscribed to a telephone\\nsecretarial service the call is automatically relayed to the office of the service\\nand relayed to the doctor or given to him when he makes his check-up.\\nDoctors may arrange to call the Service at certain intervals during the day to\\npick up incoming calls or they may arrange for a relay of calls during the day.\\nWhile the service is extensively used by doctors, other professional men and\\nwomen or those in small shops have found the service valuable. Frequently\\nthe business of a contractor, an interior decorator, or a commercial\\nphotographer does not warrant a full-time secretary. By making use of a\\ntelephone service, he can leave his office or shop on business and know that\\nany important calls coming in will be handled.\\nA number of people have started such a service in a small way and built it up\\nto where it makes an excellent income. The Telephone Answering Service of\\nNew York City, for instance, now has about eleven branches in addition to\\nthe general office. This Service also has arrangements in other large cities\\nwhereby the same name is used for directory listing in order to facilitate the\\nuse of the service.A number of young women are operating a telephone secretarial service from\\ntheir own homes. Usually when the service is operated on a small scale, all\\nthe subscribers to it are located in one building. For instance, you may be\\nable to secure 30 to 50 doctors in a near-by building as subscribers to your\\nservice.\\nThe service for subscribers varies in accordance with the need for it. One man\\nmay want only a noon-hour service, another a day service, and another a 24-\\nhour service. There are other variations, of course. Holidays and Sundays\\nmay or may not be included, according to the subscriber’s requirements. In\\naddition to handling incoming calls, the service may also relay calls to\\nsubscribers. Charges are based upon the type of service required.\\nEven the physically handicapped can find some measure of financial\\nindependence in this work. A young woman living in Marion, Indiana, who\\nhas been an invalid for a number of years makes her living by operating a\\nphysicians’ telephone service from her home. Although she can get about\\nonly by means of a wheel chair, and is often confined to her bed, this\\ncourageous young woman manages a business of her own that any young\\nperson would be proud to own. She has arranged with the doctors of her\\ncommunity to keep her informed of their whereabouts and their patients may\\ncall her at any hour.\\nArrangements can be made with the local telephone company to rent the\\nnecessary equipment. In view of the fact that the company invests\\nconsiderable money in an undertaking of this sort, it must be assured as to the\\ncharacter and financial integrity of the lessee. Building up a service of this\\nsort requires little but a sense of responsibility, initiative, and a willingness to\\nwork. If there is no such telephone service in your town, talk it over with the\\nlocal telephone manager. Such a service may be just what your town needs\\nand, incidentally, the answer to your problem of what to do to make some\\nmoney.\\nSpecializing in Dog Sketches\\nTHE name Diana Thorne immediately calls up a picture of a most successful\\nartist. Yet Miss Thorne had a tremendously difficult time just earning enough\\nto keep body and soul together until she found the way to capitalize her skill.\\nLike many another person with a talent, many a man or woman with a clever\\nbusiness idea, she lacked the right slant on her work. She failed to specialize;\\nshe made no effort to stand out from the crowd.\\nMiss Thorne had all the advantages of study in Germany and England. But in\\nLondon, when nineteen years old (this was at the beginning of the war), she\\nsold and mended typewriters, worked as a reporter, as a typist, as a scenario\\nwriter—anything to make some sort of living. She could find no demand for\\nher sketches and almost despaired of getting ahead. When she returned to\\nNew York, she turned to typing to earn a living for herself and younger sister\\nand brother. She admits that today she might still be struggling along except\\nfor a dog. She found him in a pet shop, and while his antecedents were\\nprobably not to be checked too carefully, he made a marvelous model. She\\nwas amused by his puppy antics, the clumsiness of his pudgy body and the\\nfrequent expressions of bewilderment at the strange world about him. She\\nsketched him and sketched him, and in 1926 Diana Thorne sold her first dog\\npicture—a young girl skating at breakneck speed behind a terrier. She called\\nit “Rollin’ Home”—and it clicked. Just putting an appealing little pup in a\\npicture made the difference between “sold” and “no sale.”\\nShe found that nine out of ten people like dogs—especially puppies. A\\npicture of a puppy just “gets them.” So with pencil and brush she pictured\\nthem in every conceivable mood, every sort of pose. The more Diana Thorne\\nsketched dogs the better she sketched them. People stopped to look at her\\nsketches because the puppies were appealing. Then they took a second look\\nfor these puppies were real dogs. Diana Thorne had made a hit with the great\\nmass of dog lovers. Before long, dog owners were requesting her to do\\nsketches of their own dogs. Today, pedigreed pets are brought to her from all\\nover the world to have their portraits done. She has become a dog illustrator\\nof renown both here and in Europe. You look at the pictures of her Scotties\\nand think they are the best she has done. Then you see the Spaniels, and you\\nthink they are the most cunning. Yet the Boston Terriers may intrigue you\\neven more. Diana Thorne has “arrived.”If you feel that you cannot make a success of the one good talent you possess,\\nif your business for some reason does not succeed, look around for an idea\\nthat will put your work above that of your competitors. If you make things,\\nthere is a way to make them more attractive to the buyer; if you sell things,\\nyou can change your method of selling so it will mean the difference between\\nsuccess and failure. Whatever you do, you can find some new slant that will\\nopen up a market for you.\\nA New Slant on the “Grab Bag” Idea“\\nH\\nERE is my recipe for making $1,000,” said Chester Ryan. “Get some ‘Gold\\nDiggers.’ This novelty machine which looks like a small traveling crane or\\nexcavator, operates for a penny or a nickel. Five or six dollars’ worth of\\nnovelty merchandise, together with a quantity of candy, is placed in it and the\\nlittle excavator picks out the candy or a novelty, depending upon your luck.\\nThe novelties include cameras, fancy cigarette lighters, wrist watches,\\nfountain pens, celluloid dice and similar items. These novelties may be\\nredeemed by the store owner or retained by the lucky player as desired. I buy\\ngood-looking cameras for three dollars a dozen, cigarette lighters for three-\\nsixty a dozen, and fountain pens for twenty-nine cents. I can get cheaper\\narticles but they do not have the looks. This is an important factor in your\\nsuccess, for the secret of getting people to ‘go for’ your cameras, lighters,\\nwatches, etc., is the appearance of quality in these items. They must look\\ngood and they must look easy for the ‘digger’ to pick up.\\n“While the retail selling price of any article in the case may be only a dollar\\nor two, the fun of taking a chance seems to be sufficient to get most players\\nto take a few chances. The machine needs little servicing and always works.\\nWhen I started using them, however, I made the mistake of thinking I could\\nget by with shoddy merchandise. I didn’t know much about picking the best\\nlocations either.\\n“Realizing that one good location is worth ten poor ones, I studied ways of\\nselecting choice spots. I learned quickly that the fellow who wants to make\\nbig money has to study locations as scientifically as the chain stores. He must\\ncheck the number of persons entering a drug store, barber shop, cigar store,\\ncandy store or delicatessen. He should know just about when the big crowd\\ncomes in and if there ever is a big crowd. He will find that if a crowd hangs\\naround a place for an hour and then moves on with practically no more\\npatronage coming in that night, there is no chance of success with this\\nmachine. At best, a machine in such a place will take in only about ten dollarsa week. A tavern, cafe, drug store, or candy store on a good neighborhood\\ncorner in any city, however, has people coming in and out all afternoon and\\nevening. If more than five people are in the store all the time, you can bet that\\nyour average play on the excavator is going to be pretty good. A machine\\nplaced in a location of that kind will easily ‘kick out’ a profit of twenty-five\\nor thirty dollars a week.\\n“I pay my store owners a 35 per cent commission on the amount in the cash\\nbox, less redemption pay-off. That’s a liberal split, but then I have my\\nmachines in good spots and it’s worth the difference. In one drug store where\\nI placed a machine a year ago, the play runs twenty-nine dollars a day. It’s a\\nbusy place all day long. A number of doctors drop in there off and on, and\\nthey never go out without putting from fifty cents to a dollar in the machine.\\nBecause of the heavy play in this place, I have to drop around every three or\\nfour days and put in new merchandise.\\n“One reason why the ‘gold digger’ is so popular is because of the average\\nman’s belief he can beat these machines. As a matter of fact no machine is\\nmade to be beaten. It’s made to pay a profit, and always does. But the belief\\nis strong enough to cause people to play them over and over again. They\\ndon’t care what they win. Their objective is to beat the game. A few do beat\\nit. But a majority don’t. All play it for the fun of playing and for the sport of\\nwinning. That’s the spirit that animates every player.”\\nDuring his first five months operating these machines, Ryan’s profit\\namounted to well over a thousand dollars. He bought the machines outright,\\npaying eighty-nine dollars for each one. If you intend operating a machine of\\nthis kind, it might be well to start with one or more secondhand machines,\\nwhich may be picked up at small cost. There is real money to be made in this\\nenterprise.\\nService to Mothers Becomes a Business\\nO\\nVER two million babies are born in this country every year. That means amarket for all sorts of clothing, equipment, toys, furniture, and other things. It\\nalso means a sizable market for equipment, clothing and supplies for the\\nmothers. It remained for a woman to think up a service that would appeal to\\nthe majority of these two million mothers. She knew that they would like to\\nfind someone who would relieve them of the incessant laundry work\\nconnected with the baby’s first year. She talked the idea over with her\\nhusband, Albert Lau. He was skeptical at first, but decided to give it a trial.\\nThe Dy-Dee Wash, Inc., Chicago, was the result.\\nThe service appeals to practically every woman with a tiny baby. The\\ncompany is developed somewhat on the towel supply service idea. It supplies\\nthe babies’ napkins, calls for the soiled laundry and leaves the clean\\n“necessaries.” Naturally a business such as this must be built on the basis of\\nabsolute cleanliness and sanitation. A trip through the plant of the Dy-Dee\\nWash proves beyond a doubt that these two requisites are not just slogans,\\nbut absolute facts. So successfully has this idea taken hold that over a dozen\\nbranches of the Dy-Dee Wash are now in operation. These are not branches\\nin the real meaning of the term as each plant is independent of the parent\\nplant. The operators of the branches merely pay for the privilege of using the\\nDy-Dee license.\\nThis money-making business is another proof that where there is a genuine\\nneed for a service in a community, the man or woman who undertakes to\\nprovide that service economically and efficiently will soon be on his way\\ntoward making his first thousand dollars and many more thousands.\\nPut a Billiard Table in a Store\\nW\\nHEN a tenant operating a cigar store in a building owned by H. L. Martin,\\nColumbus, Ohio, renewed his lease for only one-fourth of the store, Martin\\nwas worried. It was almost impossible to get store tenants at that time. No\\none seemed willing to rent the rear of a store, and Martin soon gave up hope\\nof finding a tenant. Then he considered the possibility of profitably using the\\nspace himself.A study of the cigar store’s operations revealed that the younger men were\\ninclined to remain in the store where they could meet and talk with friends\\nlate afternoons and evenings. After four o’clock each afternoon there were\\nalways several men grouped about the cigar stand, who seemed to have\\nnothing much to do. Catering to these men, reasoned Martin, providing them\\nwith wholesome amusement that would help his tenant’s cigar sales, would\\nbe profitable.\\nThere was space in the store for two or three pocket billiard tables. There\\nwere enough men in the store most of the time to justify expectation of a fair\\nplay on the tables. So Martin decided to put in two tables. His tenant liked the\\nidea, appreciating that the more people who entered the store, the more cigars\\nand cigarettes he would sell. Tables and equipment were secured, and Martin\\nopened the billiard room. He charged five cents a cue, or rented the tables to\\nplayers at fifty cents an hour. Few rented the table by the hour, however.\\nTwo, three or four men usually played and paid for each game when they\\nfinished. The play on the tables was heaviest in the afternoons and evenings,\\nand his profit for the first month was one hundred and fifty-six dollars.\\nMartin’s total investment in tables and equipment was $198. The tables,\\nbought from the manufacturer, had been reconditioned and were in good\\nplaying condition when he placed them in his store. He bought them on\\ndeferred payments, so that very little cash investment was necessary.\\nOpportunities for opening pocket billiard rooms exist in many cities, and\\nreconditioned equipment may be picked up from manufacturers everywhere.\\nStore space in good locations is readily obtainable. By making arrangements\\nwith a barber or cigar dealer for use of space in barber shop or store, your\\nrent is reduced and profit assured.\\nIn time, as your business prospers, and you have accumulated a few thousand\\ndollars in profits from it, you can spread out into a store of your own, with\\nmore tables. It is a business that requires no special training, and does not tie\\nyou down. It offers many opportunities for money-making “side lines.”\\nA Coca-Cola cooler in the corner, for instance, will make almost enough topay the rent, and a few pin games or similar attractions are sure-fire\\nmoneymakers. In these days of leisure there is a real opportunity to start a\\nbusiness which offers wholesome recreational facilities to the people in the\\ncommunity. It’s almost a “natural.” There are few easier ways to make\\n$1,000.\\nA Profitable Auto Travel Business\\nS\\nOME years ago, A. A. Preciado planned to make a trip to the West Coast by\\nautomobile. In order to reduce his expenses and, at the same time, make the\\ntrip more pleasant, he advertised for a traveling companion on the share-the-\\nexpense basis. His advertisement in the newspaper brought over a hundred\\nreplies and a similar advertisement inserted when he was ready to make his\\nreturn trip brought twice as many replies. When he reached home he realized\\nthere was an opportunity for a business catering to tourists, so he opened a\\ntravel agency which he called the “Auto Travel Bureau.”\\nMost of the “traveling companions” on his list are students, summerschool\\nteachers, college professors, and business girls. However, even doctors,\\nlawyers and movie stars have made trips as extra passengers through the\\nBureau. “Women especially hate to go on long trips alone,” he remarked,\\n“and part of my job is to locate responsible young college men to drive their\\ncars for them.”\\nBecause he filled a long-felt need and because of good business management\\nthe business grew and prospered. Today, Mr. Preciado has several assistants\\nand representatives in various key cities. He also has many competitors, but\\nhe lays claim to having been the first in the field. His cars now go all over the\\ncountry, of course, but there is a certain demand for transportation to such\\ncities as San Francisco, Chicago, St. Louis, etc., which has made it possible\\nfor him to arrange for regular transportation to such points. All rates are\\nfigured on a mileage basis—the greater the distance, the greater the cost. The\\nBureau gets a standard commission from the extra passenger, the balance\\ngoing to the car owner.A New Slant Made This Circulating Library a Success\\nW\\nHEN J. J. and R. M. Sullivan, of Chicago, investigated the circulating library\\nbusiness they discovered larger profits were in store for the library which\\ndelivered its books regularly to readers, rather than waited for readers to drop\\nin for books when they felt inclined. Making no provision for drop-in\\nbusiness they rented room space only in an office building on the north side\\nof town, and stocked a few volumes of standard authors. With a dozen of\\nthese volumes in a shopping sack each began making the rounds of the large\\noffice buildings on Michigan Avenue and in the central business district of\\nthe city. Secretaries, stenographers and clerks were, for the most part, the\\nclientele at which they aimed. When a secretary on whom they called was not\\ninterested in the standard author they offered, one of the Sullivan brothers\\nwould inquire her taste in books and ask what book she would like him to\\nbring her the following week.\\nMaking up their lists in this way from the preferences and requests of the\\noffice people on whom they called, they eventually built up a library of\\nseveral thousand volumes and a clientele of twenty-eight hundred customers.\\nThe charge for membership in this perambulating library was one dollar and\\nthe rental fifty cents per week on books costing three dollars and over, thirty-\\nfive cents on books from two dollars and a half to three dollars, and twenty-\\nfive cents per week on books under two dollars and a half. The Sullivan\\nbrothers each had regular days for calling on specified buildings, and they\\nmade the rounds of their entire clientele once a week.\\nIn order not to overload themselves unnecessarily with books in their daily\\nrounds, each night preceding their morning call, they went over the file cards\\nof the clients on whom they would call the following day, noting the books\\nthey had already read and making a selection from their new stock which\\nwould suit their customers’ tastes. If, for instance, a client had started to read\\nJalna or The Whiteoaks of Jalna, he was sure to want Finch’s Fortune next\\nand then The Master of Jalna, also by the same author. A client who liked\\nHugh Walpole would be glad to get Vanessa; and a client who liked WilliamFaulkner would probably like Erskine Caldwell.\\nWhen Well of Loneliness was published, the brothers made a killing, buying\\nfour hundred copies of this book, charging fifty cents per week rental and\\nallowing members to hold it for one week only. For two years the four\\nhundred volumes were in constant circulation. Another big renter was Mrs.\\nMitchell’s Gone with the Wind. Four hundred copies of this book were\\nbought and kept in steady circulation.\\nBooks like these bring in tidy profits to the Sullivans. They guessed wrong,\\nhowever, on Ulysses and, in this case, were overloaded with a book the\\npublic did not want. They buy their books wholesale for 30 per cent off, or\\nfrom the publishers for 40 per cent off. This latter arrangement seldom\\nrepresents any saving, however, because of the cost of expressage.\\nWhen books are finished as renters and stop moving entirely, they are sold to\\nhospitals or other institutions and also to second-hand bookstores.\\nGetting personally acquainted with their clientele, knowing their tastes, and\\nhaving the patience and the time to come back if a girl is busy taking\\ndictation when they call (so that she can always depend upon the arrival of\\nher new book and the collection of her old one) have been chiefly responsible\\nfor the many steady and well-satisfied customers which these two Sullivans\\nhave accumulated. A satisfied customer in any business is the best\\nadvertising it can have.\\nA Clipping Service for Artists\\nW\\nHILE Carl Jackson was selling magazine subscriptions to artists and their\\nfriends, he learned that they frequently were at a loss for authentic\\nillustrations to follow in making drawings. In the larger cities, the public\\nlibraries have files of illustrations but it takes a great deal of valuable time to\\nlocate what is needed—and time to an artist is money. So he started a\\nclipping service for artists. During the past two years, he has made better than\\nfifteen hundred a year at practically no expense from this enterprise. “Thegood artist, the leader in the field, uses my service as much as the poor man\\nwho can’t afford to hire models,” Jackson pointed out. “Here in Chicago\\nseveral hundred men and women make their living from art work of one kind\\nor another. They can’t buy all the magazines that are published (especially\\nthe higher priced foreign publications) because it would take every cent they\\nearn to do it. And they might never get an idea out of the publications they do\\nbuy. But there is art work in every magazine. I clip the well-drawn\\nillustrations from a group of picked magazines and index them. I am able to\\nsupply almost any type of illustration that an artist wants whenever he wants\\nit, for making a sketch. For example, an artist is told to make a drawing that\\ncalls for an archer of the Robin Hood period. He could make the long trip to\\nthe library, secure the pictures needed and make several sketches. Instead of\\nwasting so much time, he calls me on the phone. I go to my file, pick out two\\nor three, and send them to him. My fee is three dollars.\\n“You see forty-seven steel filing cabinets here. I started with one, and about\\nthree dozen magazines, which I had been carrying as samples when I was\\nwith the magazine subscription agency. I clipped every illustration and told a\\nfew artists about it. They had some special work such as illustrating a school\\ntextbook or making a drawing of old Mexico for a magazine and they needed\\ncertain kinds of clippings. I happened to have them. The fees I got out of the\\nillustrations from magazines enabled me to buy other magazines. I picked\\nsome up for a song at second-hand book stores and I subscribed to the\\nleading periodicals. One artist told another, and it wasn’t long before I was\\ndoing a highly profitable business. Then I wrote a letter to several film\\ncompanies, and explained the type of service I was offering artists, and\\nmentioned that some of them had requested photographs of film stars to be\\nused for magazine purposes. I was given a break by two studios, with the\\nunderstanding that under no circumstances were the photographs sent me to\\nbe used for advertising in any way. The movie people have a remarkable\\nfacility for artistically posing their subjects and the artists were hungry for\\nthose photographs. They bought them outright, at good prices, and for one\\nlot, I received seventy-five dollars.\\n“In many cases the clippings are returned by the artist. When an artist returns\\nthe clippings in good condition, I allow him a discount of 50 per cent. On anaverage, I have nine calls for clippings, daily. Since most of the clippings are\\nreturned to my files, I average a dollar and eighty cents an order. I deliver and\\nmake the collections myself.”\\nFrequently meeting a problem of a group of persons, such as artists, provides\\na service which is invaluable to the group, and at the same time, is highly\\nprofitable to you. A similar service for artists may be started in any town\\nwhere there are enough artists to make a clipping service pay. However, the\\nservice need not be restricted to one locality. It may be expanded by mail to\\ninclude near-by cities or towns, where such a service is certain to be highly\\nappreciated. Practically no investment is required.\\nStarts Printing Business at Sixty-Five\\nH\\nALF a century ago, in the little town of Rossville, Illinois, Frank Frailey\\ndecided to learn the printer’s trade. His stepfather owned the hotel in that\\nvillage, and until he became a “printer’s devil,” Frank had spent most of his\\ntime making beds, waiting on tables, stoking the old-fashioned stoves, and\\ndoing the many other odd jobs that turn up around the small town inn. But in\\nthose days, the printer was the aristocrat of the trades, going to work with a\\nlong frock coat and high silk hat. To a young man, the idea of becoming such\\na grand fellow was fascinating.\\nSo a printer he became, and a good one. In turn, he drifted from Rossville to\\nDanville, to Bloomington, to Springfield, and finally to the twin cities of\\nChampaign-Urbana, where he has spent the most of his life. For a while, he\\nworked as foreman of several of the local shops, and with the UrbanaCourier\\nHerald. “Dad” Frailey became known as a printer who planned each job with\\nas much feeling for craftsmanship as the painter who does a picture, or the\\nmusician who writes a symphony. There are few printers today who can\\nequal “Dad” as a typographer. Soon he had his own shop in Urbana, and\\nleading business men went to him for their printing jobs, and the students at\\nthe University of Illinois for their dance programs.But the life of the owner of a printing shop is strenuous. “Dad” Frailey’s boy\\nhad finished college, and there seemed no reason why his father should\\ncontinue to work so hard. He sold his business, and became the shop\\nsuperintendent for the Twin City Printing Company. He owned his home and\\nhad accumulated enough money to live comfortably. But he did not want ever\\nto forsake the smell of printer’s ink or the clang of the Gordon presses, as\\nstrong a lure to the printer as the odor of the sawdust and the clop of horses’\\nhoofs, to the circus performer. He meant to go on working until his time on\\nearth had ended.\\nBut there came a day when the owner of the business decided that he could\\nreduce expenses by putting a younger man in charge of the shop. “Dad”\\nFrailey was more than sixty. It was time for him to retire. “Too old to work\\nany longer, you ought to take things easier,” said the proprietor— words that\\nbegin to haunt all men and women who have passed fifty, and words that\\nmany thousands heard during the depression. So they were spoken to “Dad”\\nseven years ago in the front office of the Twin City Printing Company, and\\nhe left that night, branded “too old to work.”\\nBut there was something different between “Dad” Frailey and the majority of\\nmen who face the same problem. He didn’t agree that he was too old, and he\\ndidn’t intend to take things easy. He knew that the quickest way for him to\\ndie would be to sit around doing nothing. That night there occurred a\\ndirectors’ meeting in the Frailey homestead. Mr. and Mrs. Frank L. Frailey\\nwere the members present. “I’m going to start a little shop of my own right\\nhere in this house,” said the president of the corporation. “I’ll buy some type,\\na press, a cutter, and the other things I need—there are a lot of folks in these\\ntwo towns who know my work and like it. They’ll be glad to give me as\\nmany jobs as I can handle. Now down in the basement—”\\nBut that was when the meeting got warm. No woman wants a printing plant\\nin her basement—too much noise and confusion. So they finally\\ncompromised on the little one-car garage which up to that moment had done\\nnothing more eventful than house several cars made and sold by another\\nelderly man who seems destined to keep on working—Henry Ford. And in\\nthat brick garage—no bigger than a tourist’s cabin—“Dad” Fraileyestablished a new business—one with very little overhead and soon quite\\nprofitable. It was only a year or so until every inch of floor space was\\ncrowded with the tools and machinery of the master printer. The news got\\naround somehow that “Dad” was still turning out superior printing, and he\\nhas never had a dull minute, or had to solicit a single job. With only a young\\nman to kick the press, and a girl occasionally for bindery work, this man who\\nwas “too old to work any longer” has often averaged $100 a week clear profit\\nin his little brick printing shop.\\nWhy? Well, perhaps, “Dad” himself has explained the secret of his success\\nby quoting from Emerson on one of his folders: “If a man write a better book,\\npreach a better sermon, or build a better mouse trap than his neighbor, though\\nhe build his house in the woods, the world will make a beaten path to his\\ndoor.” Mouse traps or printing—it is all the same. The man who has achieved\\ndistinction in any kind of craftsmanship, who is still strong in body and\\nyoung in spirit, need not fear the specter of old age.\\nBe a “Free Lance” Photographer\\nB\\nIG money can be made taking “human interest” photographs. That has been\\nproved by Lee Clarke, who has averaged $15 daily by snapping his camera\\naround Chicago during the past several months.\\nClarke started “shooting” human interest photographs when he entered a\\ncontest conducted by an out-of-town newspaper. The paper promised to pay\\nfive dollars for each photograph published. Clarke decided he could pay for a\\ncamera with money accruing to him from photographing unusual subjects for\\nthe contest, and bought a second-hand camera for which he paid $73.\\nIncluded were two packs of films. He made “close-up” photographs of points\\nof interest in and around Chicago which he mailed to the newspaper. A week\\nlater he received a check for $80 in payment for sixteen of the twenty-four\\npictures. He did not win the prize, but in the next three weeks received\\nchecks totaling $70 for photographs from various newspaper syndicates and\\nadvertising agencies throughout the country. That you will agree, was mightygood money.\\n“Many photographs are not salable,” Clarke pointed out, “because they have\\npoor composition, or lack human interest. You can take a photograph one\\nway, and it doesn’t mean anything. Take the photograph from a ‘sharp’ angle,\\nhowever, and it stands out. Photographs of kittens, puppies, babies and\\nprominent people sell best. Snap a good photograph of a small kitten poking\\nits head above the rim of a shoe, and you have something that will bring five\\ndollars or more from a newspaper syndicate. I put three little brown, curly-\\nhaired puppies in a wire paper basket, took a fast close-up of them, and got\\n$20 for it from a New York advertising agency. They used it sometime later\\nto advertise a client’s canned dog food. Another reason why Lee Clarke’s\\npictures sell is that he analyzes the pictures being used today in national\\nadvertising, watches the trend, and then keys his output accordingly.\\nBecause developing and printing negatives and prints has a great deal to do\\nwith the salability of a photograph, Clarke has it done by professionals who\\nknow best how to get results. Some photographers prefer to develop their\\nfilms themselves. It costs him twenty cents to have a film-pack developed,\\nand he pays five cents for each print. Not every photograph he takes sells, of\\ncourse, but his average is about one in nine. He takes between thirty-five and\\nforty photographs every day and his costs, including films, printing and\\ndeveloping run close to six dollars daily.\\nYou can readily discover the best angle from which to take a photograph by\\nstudying the subject through the camera ground glass. The image shown in\\nthe ground glass is exactly the same as that which will appear in the finished\\nphotograph. Making camera studies in spare time will prove lucrative and\\nenjoyable. Newspaper syndicates, magazine publishers, advertising agencies,\\nbig corporations, department stores, dress shops, men’s stores, and schools\\nfurnish a ready market for the proper type of photograph. Striking\\nphotographs are hard to find but there are many opportunities for snapping\\nthem right in your own community. If you have good “camera sense” and\\ndevelop the necessary skill, you will find a good market for out-of-the-\\nordinary photographs among companies which produce calendars for\\nsyndicating the retail stores, such as, the Gerlach Barklow Company of Joliet,or Brown & Bigelow of St. Paul. There are men like John Kabel, of Dayton,\\nwho earn upward of $10,000 a year just traveling about taking “calendar”\\nphotographs. Can you imagine any business more pleasant?\\nSelling Sales Information\\nI\\nN EVERY city there are usually four or five dealers, in various household\\nproducts. There is an electrical dealer who sells washing machines and\\nsimilar devices. There is usually a utility company selling gas stoves. There is\\na store which sells radios. Another sells oil burners. And in the last few years\\nstores are being established to sell air-conditioning equipment. All of these\\nbusiness men work on “leads”—that is to say they need to know the names of\\npeople in town who are contemplating buying equipment such as they sell, so\\nthat they can call on these “prospects” and interest them in their particular\\nappliances.\\nTo get “leads” by a door-to-door canvass is expensive. It costs a lot of\\nmoney, and takes too many salesmen, although it is being done. If these\\ndealers can be shown how they could get such “leads” for less money, so that\\nthey could keep all their salesmen busy calling on known prospects, they\\nwould jump at the opportunity. An advertising man who was out of work,\\nfigured that by making a personal canvass of every house in town, he could\\nfind out from one call what these five dealers make five calls to learn, thus\\nmeeting the first requirement of a successful business-rendering a definite\\nand needed service.\\nSo he had some blanks printed, on which he listed various questions designed\\nto secure from the housewife such information as: (1) Do you use a vacuum\\ncleaner? (2) How old is it? (3) When will you be ready to trade your present\\nvacuum cleaner for a new one? (4) What make of vacuum cleaner will you\\nprobably buy? He headed up these blanks with the imposing title: “Rockford\\nHome Equipment Survey.” With about 50 of these blanks in a loose-leaf\\nbinder he started out making his calls. He introduced himself in the following\\nmanner:“My name is Stamm. I am making a survey of household appliances being\\nused in Rockford homes for an article in the Rockford Star and Register.”\\n(He previously had approached the publisher of the newspaper who said he\\nwould be glad to publish the summary of his investigations in his news\\ncolumns. It helped his advertisers.) “Would you be good enough to answer a\\nfew questions about the gas and electrical appliances which you are using in\\nyour home?”\\nNext he went to the leading dealers, showed them the sort of information he\\nwas obtaining as a result of his calls, and asked them if they would be willing\\nto pay him 25 cents for every lead he obtained for equipment such as they\\nwere selling. He admitted frankly that some of the leads would be names of\\npeople with whom the dealer was already in contact, but demonstrated that\\nthere would be such a small percentage of these that it would not represent\\nmuch of a waste. In many such cases he obtained data that the dealer did not\\nhave, but which were helpful to him such as, for example, the home-owner’s\\npreference for equipment sold by his competitor. This proposition, of course,\\nwas made to only one dealer in each line of business, first come first served.\\nIn nearly every case where Stamm called he got a lead for at least one of his\\n“clients” and in many cases for all five. He found he was able to canvass\\nabout forty home-owners in a day, working evenings as well as during the\\ndaytime. Since it was all profit, except for the cost of printing up the\\nquestionnaires, you can figure out how long it took him to make $1,000.\\nThis same idea, in a slightly different form, was used by the Women’s Guild\\nof St. Luke’s Episcopal Church in Evanston, Illinois, to raise funds for the\\nchurch budget. Each woman in the church was given a page from the\\nEvanston telephone directory, and required to call up these names within a\\nmonth. She was furnished with blanks printed for the purpose. In this case,\\nhowever, a wide range of needs was covered by the survey, including\\nautomobiles, tires, radios, water heaters, incinerators, etc. Hundreds of dollars\\nwere raised as a result of the plan.\\nMaking Money with a Portable DuplicatorW\\nHEN Mildred Connery graduated from business college, she intended to start\\nout on a secretarial career. She soon discovered it was impossible to find a\\njob, so she became a public stenographer. Business didn’t rush into her\\noffice, though, and there were days when she had no work to do.\\n“The way to get business is to go after it,” thought Mildred. “But how am I to\\ngo after it?” She considered various ways, and tried a few without success.\\nShe left cards in offices. She called on business men in the building where\\nshe rented space. But her business didn’t increase. One day a small boy\\nentered her office with a magazine in his hand. Holding the magazine out to\\nher, he said: “Ten cents.” She paid him, saying she wished she could make\\nsales as quickly as he did. “All you have to do is show the thing you’re\\nselling, and name the price,” said the boy.\\n“That boy didn’t know it but he gave me an idea,” declared Mildred. “I\\nthought if I could find some way to show the kind of work I did for people, I\\ncould make money. Up to that time I had practically no stencil business. I\\nknew small business men were using form letters, and got them somewhere.\\nLater I recalled using a portable duplicating machine in school, and I decided\\nto get one, carry it from office to office, and leave a sample of the kind of\\nwork it did in each office I visited.”\\nThe success of this plan was immediate. Mildred did not say a word to\\nanyone when she entered an office. She opened the duplicator, ran off a\\nsample letter, handed it to the business man, and smiling, waited for him to\\nremark about it. This sample letter was illustrated with a tracing of a girl’s\\nhead, and read: “This is a sample of the duplicating work I will do for you.\\nNote the perfect typewriter ribbon ‘match.’ You can fill in the names and\\naddresses on these letters on your typewriter if you wish. Glance over the\\nfollowing low prices, and give me a trial order.” Detailed list of prices\\nfollowed. Her entire investment, including the portable duplicator and other\\nincidentals, was thirty dollars. Mildred secured eighteen small orders the first\\nday and her net profit was sixty dollars for the week. The demonstration\\nrequired but a few seconds, since this machine is ready to operate themoment it is opened. The sample letter was short enough to be read quickly,\\nand the prices quoted were reasonable. In addition, the illustration which was\\na tracing from a magazine drawing, gave the business man an idea of the\\npossible uses for this type of letter.\\nAnyone securing one of those portable duplicators can build a good income\\nin the same way Mildred did if the business is there. Small business concerns,\\nlawyers, sales agents and real estate men are the best prospects since they\\nregularly use small quantities of letters and price lists. Restaurants and drug\\nstores with lunch counters often have a number of menus run off for\\ncirculation in the vicinity of their stores. As many as three thousand copies\\nmay be run off from one stencil.\\nHuntingRareCoins\\nA\\nNEWSPAPER story about a woman who sold a half dollar to a coin\\ncollector for $400 prompted W. F. Williams to devote his spare time to a\\nsearch for rare coins. He got a list of “wanted” pennies, nickels, quarters, and\\nhalf dollars and memorized the dates and mint marks of all coins for which\\nbig premiums were offered. Each night he examined every small coin he had\\nreceived during the day when changing paper money in restaurants, cigar\\nstores, and gasoline stations, and this spare time effort paid handsome profits.\\nWilliams declares that many coins are worth more than one thousand times\\ntheir face value, and that there are thousands of wanted American coins\\ncirculating throughout the country every day, their value unknown to their\\nowners.\\n“The first coin I sold was a 1913 Liberty Head nickel. This brought me $50\\nand encouraged me to search for other rare coins,” said Williams. From a\\nstreet car conductor a few days later, he received an American half-dime in\\nchange, a silver piece minted in 1803. “That conductor believed he was\\ngiving me a dime when he handed me that small silver piece. I was glad to\\nget it, however, for I sold it a few days later for $30. One day, about a week\\nlater, I was stepping up to pay my check in a lunch room. The man ahead ofme was arguing with the cashier about a coin handed out in change for a\\ndollar bill. It was a half dollar minted in 1853, and the cashier said it was\\ngood as any. ‘I’ll take it,’ I said as carelessly as possible. I got $165 for it two\\nweeks later.”\\nWilliams didn’t get all of his rare coins that way. He purchased some at\\nnominal prices from friends and neighbors, and resold them at a handsome\\nprofit. A friend of his dug up an old tin can in his backyard which contained\\namong other coins, seven dimes dated 1894, and knowing Williams was\\nsearching for 1894 dimes, he brought them all over to Williams. Williams\\ncarefully examined them, selected one, and offered a dollar for it. His friend\\nsold it willingly. “You see,” Williams explained, “he thought all those dimes\\nhad the same value. The one I selected was the only one of the seven,\\nhowever, that was worth more than ten cents. That coin had an ‘S’ mint mark\\non it which made it valuable. A little later I was paid $100 for it.”\\nAmong the American coins for which premiums have been offered are: half-\\ncent piece, dated 1796 for which up to $75 is offered; a one-cent piece dated\\n1799 commands up to $80; up to $150 will be paid for an 1802 halfdime; up\\nto $300 for an 1827 quarter-dollar; up to $500 for an 1838 halfdollar New\\nOrleans mint, marked with an “O” between bust and date; up to $250 for an\\n1853 half-dollar; up to $2,500 for an 1804 silver dollar; up to $250 for an\\n1885 trade dollar; up to $250 for an 1863 “S” mint two-dollarand-a-half gold\\npiece; up to $500 for a gold dollar (North Carolina) letter “C” below the\\nwreath; up to $1,000 for an 1873 three-dollar gold piece; and up to $5,000 for\\nan 1822 U. S. five-dollar gold piece. Hundreds of other coins are listed at\\nvalues ranging between $15 and $70.\\nAnyone may turn his spare time into a profitable search for wanted American\\ncoins. A complete list of wanted coins may be obtained from a reliable coin\\ncollector. These lists show the dates, marks, and other specifications which\\nwill enable you to identify wanted coins, and the prices collectors will pay for\\nthem. By examining them through a magnifying glass (which you may buy at\\nany novelty store for twenty-five or fifty cents), coins worn smooth by\\nhandling, special mint letters and marks become clear which cannot be\\ndetected with the naked eye.When a rare coin comes into your possession mail it to a coin dealer, and he\\nwill send you his check promptly. Be sure that the coin collector is reliable\\nand can show references for fair dealing. There are a lot of fakers among coin\\ndealers just as there are among stamp dealers.\\nA Handy Shop in Your Home\\nM\\nRS. LINDSTROM , of Wilmette, Illinois, has always been a very energetic\\nand busy woman. When her husband’s business, which was sanding and\\nrefinishing floors, began to slip she decided to give a lift and add to the\\nfamily income.\\nHer forte was sewing, so she conceived the idea of starting a “Handy Shop”\\nright in her own home. She inserted a small advertisement in the local paper\\nannouncing that the “Handy Shop” was ready to mend, quilt, make over\\nclothes, and in general do any of the little odd jobs that so many women\\nneglect, just because they don’t like to do them or haven’t the time.\\nNot long after the advertisement appeared, many small repair jobs started\\ncoming in. Then later, as her reputation grew, not only repair jobs but orders\\nfor work on new materials were received. Soon the business outgrew the\\ncorner in the dining room of their big old-fashioned house and it was\\nnecessary to turn the whole dining room with its cheerful bay window into a\\nworkshop that fairly hums with activity from early morning hours until night.\\nShelves for storage and wardrobe space for hanging the finished garments\\nline the walls.\\nMrs. Lindstrom soon outgrew the repair and overhauling jobs, and for the\\npast four years has been busily engaged in making draperies, fine satin\\ncomforters, appliqued and patch work quilts, as well as regular dressmaking.\\nLately she has had to hire extra help to meet her delivery dates.\\nFor some time the “Handy Shop” was the sole support of the entire family of\\nsix, her husband’s business having just gradually died out. The husband isnow engaged in another line of work, her two grown sons are also employed,\\nand the daughters are off to school, but the shop hums on busier than ever.\\nThis idea has always been a “pet dream” of Mrs. Lindstrom’s, but it took a\\nreal need to develop it. Today she counts among her clientele some of\\nChicago’s best North Shore families and several large interior decorating\\nshops.\\nWhen you ask her if she is going to retire, since the family is now able to get\\nalong without her help, she quickly answers, “Oh no! This is my business,\\nand I intend to carry on full steam just so long as the orders come in.” So far\\neach year has shown a substantial gain in profits over the previous year.\\nACountryStoreonWheels\\nI\\nNSTEAD of sitting in their crossroads country store waiting for business to\\npick up, Rea & Moore, storekeepers near Logansport, Indiana, went out after\\ntheir customers. They built a body, lined with shelving, on their old truck and\\nstarted out to sell the farmers. A sufficient stock of groceries is put in the\\ntruck for a day’s trade. Four and one-half days each week this traveling store\\nis on the road covering a seven-mile radius. About 200 farmhouses are\\nvisited. When the truck drives into the dooryard, a flight of steps is put down\\nand the housewife steps up into the “store.” Here she can select the groceries\\nshe needs, paying in cash or eggs.\\nIn addition to saving the farmer’s wife the trip to town to buy her necessities,\\nit saves her the trip to market her eggs. The overhead is not more than $1.25 a\\nday for gas and oil as the truck travels only about 15 miles a day. The cost of\\nbuilding the new body on the old truck ran about $65, but as the first four\\nmonths of the experiment quadrupled their business, Rea & Moore feel that it\\nwas a good investment.\\n“Penny-Weight” Scales Lure Pennies“\\nH\\nOW much do you weigh?” When that question was asked Harry Larson in a\\ndrug store, back in 1933, he looked around for a scale. He dropped a penny in\\nthe slot of the coin-operated machine. A moment later he stepped off and\\nsauntered over to the counter to buy a package of cigarettes. As he stood at\\nthe cigar counter seven others stepped up and weighed themselves. Curious,\\nHarry asked the druggist how much money the scale made each month.\\n“He told me that it averaged about $20 a month, but that he didn’t own the\\nmachine. An operator had placed it there and his ‘cut’ was 25 per cent of the\\namount taken from the machine each month. The scale itself was a beauty. I\\ncould see that people were attracted to it because of its appearance, and that\\nthey wondered what it cost. I noted the name of the manufacturer and wrote\\nfor full details about becoming an operator. That was how I got started in the\\nscale business.\\n“I bought 70 machines altogether. The first three I paid for out of my savings.\\nThe other 67 were paid out of the pennies taken from the first three. These\\nfirst three machines cost me $175 and paid me a profit every month of $98.\\nThat was a pretty good return on the investment. I found that there is no\\nservicing needed for these machines and nothing to adjust. You just pick a\\ngood location, set them up, and there they are all ready to lure pennies from\\nthe curious. It’s a clean, simple proposition, and you can’t hit upon a surer or\\nbetter way of making money easily. After buying the first three scales, I\\nestablished a line of credit with the manufacturer, and got five more on the\\ntime-payment plan. The machines vary a little in their monthly earnings. The\\nfirst three locations average $33 each, the next three run $19.85 each, and\\nthere are two that pay under $17 monthly. My monthly income for the 70\\nmachines amounts to $768, a little better than $10 each. In nine months, I’ve\\nearned enough to pay for the scales, and made a good living besides.\\n“The stores where my machines are placed, are usually drug, candy, andgrocery stores. I’ve found that a live grocery and meat market, where a\\nnumber of women shop every day, is as good a location as you can get.\\nWomen are always worried about their weight. They want to know whether\\nthey’ve gained or lost, and to make sure, like to weigh themselves on the\\nsame scale all the time. Since they make a practice of doing most of their\\nshopping for meat and groceries in a neighborhood store, they patronize the\\npenny scale set up there.”\\nThere are several manufacturers of coin-operated scales. They all furnish\\ndetailed plans to help you interest merchants in keeping your scales in the\\nfront of the store, or in a spot near the cash register, where people standing\\naround to be served may step on the scale. These instructions make it easy for\\nanyone who is a hustler, and can make a convincing sales talk, to be\\nsuccessful from the start.\\nAShrimpFisherwoman\\nA\\nFTER the real estate bubble burst in Florida, Sadie Miller, like many others,\\nwas broke. In looking around for ways and means of getting back on her feet,\\nshe discovered “shrimping.” When she first opened her shrimp dock, she had\\na man running it, but after he failed to come back from a vacation up North,\\nshe decided to manage it herself.\\n“Shrimping” is hard work for anyone, but particularly hard for a woman.\\nDuring the busy season, the work goes on night and day. In rubber overalls\\nand hip boots, Sadie Miller and her helpers search for the elusive shrimp so\\nmuch in demand as bait by fishermen. As shrimps vary their habitat from day\\nto day, they must be hunted. Small or large—the size matters little. The\\nfisherman just wants fresh live bait. Because they are harder to find in winter,\\nthey are worth more. In January, February and March, when they are scarce,\\nthey bring 50 or 75 cents a dozen. In summer, the price runs as low as 25\\ncents a hundred. However, Sadie Miller never sells her catch for less than a\\ndollar a hundred.From a small start, this business has grown to the point where a number of\\nhelpers are needed during the busy season. While “shrimping” hasn’t made\\nSadie Miller wealthy by any means, she has made several times a thousand\\ndollars at it.\\nSpecializinginSocialPrinting\\nM\\nANY a successful publisher or printer today started his career with an old\\nKelsey printing press in his basement. There is an old saying that once you\\nget printers’ ink in your system you can never get it out. Frank Doubleday,\\nDon Sietz, Tim Thrift, Joe Mitchell, and Rudyard Kipling are just a few of\\nthe many who began their careers putting in their spare time “kicking” a\\nprinting press. Today, with a used printing press, there is still an opportunity,\\nnot only to make money, but to get a start toward a fascinating career in one\\nof the three allied fields: publishing, advertising, or writing.\\nSeveral years ago a young chap, who was a clerk in the offices of a large\\nChicago packing plant, started an agency for the sale of social stationery. He\\nsecured samples and a price list from a local engraver. It happened to be near\\ngraduation time so he called at the schools near by and secured orders from\\nthe students for their first engraved cards which they needed to enclose with\\ntheir graduation invitations. When the orders were ready to pack, he placed a\\nsticker in the bottom of each box giving the registration number for the\\ncopper plate from which the cards were made, his name and address, and a\\nsimple form for reordering in quantities when the present supply of cards was\\nentirely used.\\nHis success with these cards encouraged him to look around for further\\nbusiness. By watching the neighborhood newspaper, he learned of many\\nengagements and coming marriages. He noted the addresses, immediately\\ncalled on the mothers of the brides-to-be and solicited orders for wedding\\nannouncements and calling cards. Between working out ideas of his own and\\nmaking use of the sales suggestions the engraver gave him, he managed to\\nbuild up a rather nice little business. During this time he continued with hisregular job, and handled the engraving agency at night and on Saturday\\nafternoons.\\nBefore long, he decided that a small printing press might be of help to him, so\\nhe purchased a used press on the time-payment plan, installed it in the rear of\\na store and began to look around for printing orders. He found that\\nprofessional men were particularly good prospects as they were likely to put\\noff ordering their supplies until the last moment. They were glad to be able to\\nget prompt service in a hurry, and soon he had developed a good business\\namong professional men for bill heads, letterheads and envelopes. Before\\nlong, his space proved to be too small, so he selected a larger office in a\\nmodern building at a nominal rental. Here he established himself as the\\n“Society Specialty Shop.” About this time the reorders were beginning to\\ncome in for calling cards and he was also receiving many orders for engraved\\nChristmas and New Year cards.\\nIn order to get repeat business wherever possible, he made every effort to sell\\nhis customers on the idea of leaving their copper plates with him under a\\nregistered number. His sales argument was built around the importance of\\nhaving the plate kept in perfect condition so that there would be no scratches\\nor dents to mar the engraved work later. When his competitors found that he\\nhad built up a good-sized file of registered plates, he began receiving offers\\nfor his business, including the file of plates, monogram dies, etc. Within a\\nfew weeks after his competitors started to bid for his business, an opportunity\\ncame along for him to better his regular position, so he accepted the best offer\\nof the lot and sold his establishment for $1,500.\\nServicing Beer Coils a New Industry\\nT\\nHE return of legal beer opened taverns in almost every state. While in one\\nsuch tavern, Jimmy Coyle heard the bartender curse under his breath.\\n“What’s the matter?” Jimmy asked. “This blasted coil is giving trouble again.\\nThe coil cleaner fellow who ought to service it hasn’t been around for several\\nweeks.” Jimmy wondered at that. Later, he investigated and found out thatthe coils in every tavern should be cleaned thoroughly every few days, and\\nthat the tavern owners were glad to pay a regular service fee for this type of\\nservice. So he got in touch with the manufacturer of a coil cleaner and\\nestablished himself in a business of his own, servicing the beer coils in\\ntaverns, restaurants, lunch rooms, hotels, soda fountains, cafes, road houses,\\nclubs, and amusement places. As his income from this service is better than\\n$100 a week, it didn’t take him long to corral that first thousand dollars.\\n“The beauty of this coil-cleaning device,” said Jimmy, “is that anybody can\\noperate it, and no one needs experience to work it. Yet there’s a good income\\nin owning one and working up service accounts. I charge a small fee of $1.00\\nfor each bar I service, and I am now servicing 112 beer-selling bars.\\nHowever, I didn’t build up this business overnight. No sir! It took a lot of real\\nwork to build it, but I figured at the time that no matter what line of business\\nyou go into, you’ve got to work hard or you won’t make a nickel. As a matter\\nof fact, there was practically no one servicing these bars, when I started.\\nNaturally, the coils were in bad shape, and it took longer to do each job. The\\nfellow in town who had been servicing them was too busy to take care of all\\nthe business. When I started, he called me up and gave me some of his\\ncustomers’ names, and told me to be sure and call on them. I did. But the way\\nhe had handled their service had left a bad taste in their mouths, and it took\\nme a couple of months to overcome this.”\\nJimmy carries his coil cleaner in a handy case when he makes the rounds of\\nthe taverns he services. He simply connects the cleaner to the coil, turns on\\nthe little handles and the machine does the rest. This device, which is\\noperated by electricity, leaves the coils thoroughly cleaned and scoured,\\nwithout the use of chemicals, acids or steam. It can be carried anywhere, is\\ncompact and handy, and can be operated from a light socket in any taproom.\\nThe total investment Jimmy made in this equipment was $107. He owned a\\nroadster at the time he made his purchase, and was therefore ready to make\\ncalls in any emergency. The fact that the coils must be cleaned and kept clean\\nto give good tasting beer, makes the beer coil-cleaning service a permanent\\nbusiness which can be built up as big as you want to make it.This business, in its infancy now, is ideal for anyone anxious to start a\\nbusiness on small capital, with promises of good returns. There is no doubt\\nthat once established, any person who gives quick service in this industry will\\nenjoy a good business for many years to come. Jimmy was furnished\\neverything complete by the company when he bought his equipment.\\nRenting Tires Solves Sales Problem\\nW\\nHEN you think of a tire station, you think of a fellow who bought a few\\nhundred tires, procured a license, rented a store and went into business. That\\nwas the way that Harold Holt started. His investment in equipment and stock\\nwas under $300, but he didn’t set the world afire. It wasn’t until a friend\\nadvised him to learn something about business management, that he began to\\nrealize the reason he was not making enough to cover expenses was because\\nof his inexperience. So he inquired about a business management course and\\nenrolled with a well-rated correspondence school. After he had been studying\\nfor three months, be began to change things. He completed the course in\\neighteen months, but long before that, he had placed his business on a sound,\\nprofitable basis, and was well on his way to his second thousand dollars.\\n“At first I had the notion that all the business management course would\\nteach me was bookkeeping methods, and other things like that, which would\\nproduce no revenue. My bookkeeping didn’t have to be systematized. What I\\nreally needed was ideas for creating new business, and holding the business I\\nhad. I was surprised, early in the course, to discover that many of my lessons\\nwere devoted to exactly the type of businessbuilding ideas I needed. There\\nwas one example cited, showing how a man had taken an idea, worked it into\\nhis business and, finally, made a lot of money. That was the Hertz Drive-It-\\nYourself idea, and I got to thinking it over. I decided to try a similar one,\\napplying the principle to auto tires. I figured out the wholesale cost of a tire,\\nand the number of days it would take to pay for one on the rent-a-tire\\nprinciple. I was surprised at the amount of profit there would be in it. But I\\nhad no conviction that any man would want to rent an auto tire. It might begood advertising, I thought, and put up a sign, offering to rent motorists a\\nnew tire for 25 cents a day.\\n“The next morning, two men came in and rented four tires each for their cars.\\nI took their license numbers, and changed the tires. They said they needed\\nnew tires, but hadn’t money to buy them yet, and I assured them that half the\\nrental would apply to the purchase of new tires. This pleased them. When\\nthey went out, I decided I should have collected a minimum charge for daily\\nrentals, but didn’t. Later that day, I rented six more tires, made a minimum\\ncharge of 75 cents for changing tires and 50 cents for two days’ rental. That\\ngave me a little guarantee on the tires, and cut the probable risk down a great\\ndeal. I learned before the week was out, however, that there was no risk. Of\\nthe 26 tires I had rented that week, 24 were bought by the renters. The other\\ntwo were returned, and the full rental fee paid.\\n“I was surprised, moreover, to discover that in a short period, I had doubled\\nmy tire sales to non-renters, many new customers being attracted to my store\\nby the sign.”\\nBusiness management training certainly is of great value, and materially\\nhelps not only to reduce expenses, but to keep you from making dangerous\\ndecisions due to lack of experience. Such courses of instruction vary greatly\\nin price. All of them, however, are available on deferred payment of a few\\ndollars a month.\\nFiftyTwoMoney-MakingIdeas forWomen\\nO\\nNE versatile woman, who has done part-time work for over eight years,\\nclaims that any woman can make money in her spare time if she is really\\nwilling to work, will not scorn the smallest sort of job, and is prompt and\\ndependable.\\nShe emphasizes the importance of letting everybody in the community in\\nwhich you live, know that you are available for all the varieties of work youcan do. “Visit every place of business that you might serve; do not ask for\\nwork, but leave your name and address, with telephone number, and suggest\\nthat in an emergency they might be glad to know that you would work for\\nthem. Ask the president of the woman’s club, the church societies, and other\\norganizations to announce that you are available. Contact the doctors and the\\nRed Cross nurse and the local Red Cross head. Ask other women, who are\\ndoing what you are doing, to pass opportunities on to you when they are too\\nbusy to accept the work. In turn, you must remember to pass work on to them\\nwhenever possible. Have a telephone number, even if you have to pay a\\nneighbor to take calls for you. Many a hurry-up job has been lost because a\\nwoman could not be reached by telephone. Don’t refuse small jobs—if it is\\nonly for one hour’s work, take it; many such short periods of work add up at\\nthe end of a month.”\\nThe best way to discover how you can make money in your spare time is to\\nmake a list of the things you can do. When you start to make this list you will\\nbe surprised at the number of accomplishments you have acquired through\\nthe years. The following list contains a number of activities that most women\\ncan follow—in fact, you may be able to handle a half-dozen or more of these\\njobs without the difficulty of their conflicting one with the other:\\nB ook revieW groups—Any woman who is “well read” will find an enjoyable\\nand profitable diversion in getting a group of fifteen to twenty women to\\norganize a reading club, and let her review current books. A club of this type\\nmeets at the members’ homes about once a week, and a nominal membership\\nfee is charged from which the reviewer is compensated. One such reading\\nclub in the Chicago suburban area has thirty members who pay $10 for a\\nseries of twelve lectures or reviews. In this case, the woman who does the\\nreviewing arranges with a local woman to call up friends and get them to join\\nthe club. In return for her cooperation her dues are canceled.\\ns hop for out-of-toWn Customers—The professional shopper in the small town\\nsaves time and railroad fare for her customers. She need not charge them a\\nfee because the shopper’s discount given by city stores runs as high as 10 or\\n15 per cent. The shopper who makes a weekly trip to the city may earn as\\nmuch anywhere from $15 to $40 for the trip, and even more.d eLiver Books for a CirCuLating LiBrarY—A library can increase its circulation by\\ndelivering books to customers. If you have a car, you can make two or three\\ntrips a day. By making deliveries for several shops at one time, you can\\nincrease the amount of your earnings.\\nteaCh BaLLroom danCing to a group of men and Women; aLso\\nC hiLdren—Small classes can be taught in your own home. The radio or\\nphonograph records will provide the music. If there is no large academy in\\nyour town, you may be successful in starting such a school. The admission\\nfee may be paid at the door, or season tickets may be sold. Include a\\nrefreshment bar (this can be leased to someone) and get as good an orchestra\\nas you can afford.\\nt eLL fortunes—Tea rooms have found today that the addition of a fortune teller\\nhas stimulated business. The fortunes may be told with cards, the palm, or a\\ncrystal. Astrology is also popular. If you are a fair judge of human nature you\\ncan become rather adept. There are any number of books on fortune-telling\\nmethods and a little application is all that is needed. This is also a lucrative\\nbusiness at summer and winter resorts.\\nsing in a ChurCh Choir—Many churches pay for this service—naturally you must\\nhave a fair voice.\\nW ait on taBLes—Tea rooms which serve only luncheons and dinners need\\nextra help during the rush hours. Caterers, hotel restaurants, and inns also\\nemploy extra help. Leave your name and telephone number with the\\nmanagers of these places.\\nt eaCh Bridge—Many a woman who is an expert bridge player, has found,\\nwhen the family income started to decline, a way to make a good income.\\nBridge may be taught in private lessons (the charge is usually higher) or in\\ngroups. If the group meets at your home, twenty-five cents an hour for each\\nperson is a reasonable charge.\\ntake CompLete Charge of a home during iLLness—When a motheris in a hospital or convalescing at home, and no child is old enough to assume\\nresponsibility, someone is needed to take care of the household and the\\nchildren. Often this is an emergency job and pays well.\\nCounseLor for a girLs’ Camp—If you understand children and can handle them\\neasily, this work offers not only an income but a pleasant summer.\\nif You have a Car—Arrange to drive four or five neighbors to work each\\nmorning and pick them up in the evening. Give instructions in driving—a\\ncourse of lessons should bring you about $1.00 or $1.50. Take a group of\\nchildren to and from school. Leave your name and number with the local\\nhotels and travel agencies and offer your services to tourists who want to see\\nthe town. If there is a summer resort near by, meet the trains or boats and\\ndrive visitors to their hotels.\\nm end Linens and fine LaCes—With a little practice you can become an expert in\\nthis work. One of the best ways to mend linens is to weave linen threads in\\nthe worn or torn places. These may be secured from the inside of the hems.\\nLaces are more difficult. However, there are books on laces which will give\\nyou this instruction.\\nLaunder Curtains and fine Linens—Most women are fussy about\\ntheir curtains and fine linens and dislike turning them over to the average\\nlaundry. By doing excellent work, it is a simple matter to establish a\\nreputation in this field. In larger cities, where it is smoky and dusty, contract\\nto launder the curtains a certain number of times a year for a stipulated sum\\nto be paid each time the curtains are laundered.\\nt eaCh goLf—Many women play a good game of golf but have never tried to\\nteach it. There are always men and women interested in learning how to play\\nthe game. The charge varies from $2.00 to $4.50 an hour.\\norganize a Course in puBLiC speaking—Build your class around the idea that\\ntraining in public speaking develops poise and diction. Women who belong\\nto clubs and many business men can be sold on this idea. If you were good asa debater in school, you can probably handle such classes. Study the books\\nthat have been published on public speaking.\\nCoaCh BaCkWard students during their vaCations—If you have\\ndone any teaching, or if you have kept up with school work by helping your\\nchildren with their lessons, you can qualify for this work.\\nBoard ChiLdren in Your home during the summer—If your home is\\nspacious and in the country or at the seashore, you can handle a few children\\nas summer boarders. A comfortable, modern farm, where the children will get\\nexercise and good food is an ideal place.\\nCLeaning and dYeing agenCY—It is not enough to open up an agency and wait for\\nthe work to come to you. You must go out and solicit orders. One of the\\nadvantages of this business is the opportunity to repeat orders.\\nr eaL estate renting agenCY—This business can be handled in your own home.\\nContact the owners of property in your neighborhood and adjoining sections.\\nDo not neglect any chance of selling a piece of real estate if such a chance\\nshould come your way. In fact, after you have established yourself as a\\nrenting agent, you can expand into selling real estate. Study the books on real\\nestate law and contracts—you cannot acquire too much knowledge on this\\npoint.\\nprepare papers and speeChes for CLuB Women—The charges for\\nthis service depend upon the time spent in preparation and the amount of\\nresearch work done. The library will furnish you with material on any\\nsubject. The speech or paper should be carefully typed in duplicate and\\ndelivered several days before it is needed. Secure this type of work by\\ncontacting clubs and literary societies. Also watch the papers for\\nannouncements of meetings.\\ninvaLid Cooking—The care of many invalids is not so much a matter of\\nnursing as the preparation of the right food. One who has had little training in\\nnursing, but who is a good cook, is able to make food look appetizing, can\\nearn many a dollar catering to the finicky appetites of invalids. Contact thedoctors in your neighborhood to secure appointments.\\ndeveLop a\\\\an entertainment Bureau in Your toWn—Book talent\\nin your community and then contact churches, fraternal organizations, clubs.\\nA percentage of what the entertainers are paid is your commission.\\nSometimes it will be necessary to contact the larger booking agencies in near-\\nby cities for better talent than your community affords.

A moderate fee is charged for this service.\\nhandLe a sWitChBoard—Some hotels and apartment hotels are willing to provide\\nliving quarters for switchboard services. If you do not know how to operate a\\nswitchboard now, get someone to show you how and pay her by relieving her\\nat her work for an hour or so. You can also fill in during vacation absences at\\nvarious hotels and offices.\\nB ookkeeping—Many small retailers, manufacturing firms, hotels, and shops\\ncannot afford to hire a full-time bookkeeper. If you have had experience in\\nthis work at any time, you can work up a clientele by calling on these firms\\nand offering to handle their books once a month for a small sum.\\na ddress enveLopes—This may be done in your own home if you have a\\ntypewriter. Nearly every business house, letter and multigraphing shop is a\\nprospect. Register with these concerns, with the employment agencies in your\\ncity, and also with clubs, associations, etc. Some firms prefer addressing done\\nin your own handwriting. The rate for three-line addresses varies from $2.00to $3.00 a thousand. A good typist can address a thousand envelopes in a day.\\nt eaCh musiC—If your parents once spent considerable money for your music\\nlessons and you have a piano in your home, get out your old music books and\\nbrush up on technique. You will be surprised to find how easy it is to get into\\nthe swing of this again. Remember you do not have to be an accomplished\\nmusician to teach the piano. A few piano students will pay many a bill or buy\\nnew shoes or other necessities.\\nm aniCures—In every community there are women who dislike coming into\\ntown to a beauty shop. If you have a car you can give them manicures in their\\nown homes. All you need to carry with you is a kit with your instruments.\\nManicuring is easy to learn and should be well done to insure repeat business.\\nThe charge should, of course, be a little higher than in the beauty shop.\\nm anage CharitY Bazaars—Often the reason a charity bazaar or other charitable\\nenterprise does not make more money, is lack of good management. If you\\nhave a flair for this sort of thing, you can earn from 10 to 15 per cent of the\\nreceipts. After you have made a success of one or two affairs it is easy to\\nsecure the management of others.\\nt eLephoning—Many retailers have commissioned women to call their\\ncustomers and tell them about special sales or to make appointments for\\nspecial salesmen selling electric appliances, etc. The retailer pays for the\\ntelephone and adds a fee for your work. Some also pay a commission on all\\norders received.\\nt oWn investigator—Investigations for collection firms, food manufacturers,\\nmail-order concerns, and advertising agencies are frequently made by\\nwomen. Write to these concerns and tell them you can handle this sort of\\nwork. The public library will be able to tell you where to get lists of names.\\nC are of ChiLdren—Take charge of children while their parents go to the\\nmovies, bridge parties, etc., in the evenings. From 75 cents to $1.25 is the\\nusual charge. Arrange to take care of children while their parents are on\\nsummer vacations. The charge for this service will depend upon the length of\\ntime the parents are away, and other factors.e ntertain invaLids—Shut-ins and invalids find their days long and boring. If you\\nare good natured, have a pleasing voice, can read well or tell stories,\\nentertaining invalids, both young and old, will prove a profitable job. Contact\\nthe doctors, ministers, and nurses in your neighborhood.\\nt ake Care of graves—Check over the cemeteries in your town, look for\\nneglected graves, find the nearest relatives and sell them on the idea of\\nkeeping the graves planted with flowers and the grass cut. Many women have\\nfound this a lucrative line of work.\\nBoarding dogs, Cats and Birds—When people go away on their summer vacations,\\nRover, Peter, and Dickie have to be boarded as it is usually inconvenient to\\ntake them along. If you have a large place on the outskirts of town where a\\npup can run about and be happy, advertise your “boarding kennels.” Get in\\ntouch with local veterinary doctors, pet departments in the stores, and pet\\nshops. Watch the vacation notices in your neighborhood paper and check up\\nto see if the people who are leaving town have pets to board.\\ne mBroider monograms on Linens—Open a monogram shop in your own home. Sell\\nbrides on the idea of letting you monogram their fine, new linens. You might\\nadd a hemstitching service and also a hosiery mending service. The\\nhemstitching is easily done by an inexpensive attachment which can be\\nplaced on your sewing machine.\\nteaCh sWimming—If you are a good swimmer and have done a lot of swimming,\\nmake arrangements with one of the hotel swimming pools and organize\\nclasses. There should be a junior class for children and two adult classes—\\none for beginners and one for advanced students. An exhibit of fancy diving\\nand swimming at the end of each term will maintain interest in the classes. If\\nyour funds are low in the beginning, offer to teach the hotel guests free in\\nreturn for the use of the pool.\\nW ith Your Camera—If you possess a good camera and have some skill in\\ntaking pictures, specialize on taking snaps of children, pets, and people’s\\nhomes. Parents are proud of their children and will nearly always buy your\\nsnaps. People like pictures of their pets and their homes—snap them and thenwhen they are developed, show them. Nine times out of ten they will buy\\nyour snaps. Take pictures at summer camps of the children, of picnic crowds.\\nWatch for the unusual—freaks of nature, a sudden storm over a valley, a\\ndramatic occurrence. The trade papers, newspapers, and magazines will buy\\nthese snaps. The Eastman Kodak Company has published several inexpensive\\nbooklets which will give you a number of ideas about making money with a\\ncamera. These booklets are to be found in camera shops and the public\\nlibraries.\\nt raining animaLs and Birds—Many women are successful in this field because\\nthey have the patience of Job and they are naturally kind to their pets. One\\nwoman has been unable to supply the demand for her trained cats. The cats\\nare trained when they are little kittens and are so droll and amusing, her entire\\nsupply is always in demand. Another woman has had considerable success\\ntraining canaries to sing special songs such as “Yankee Doodle.” She also is\\nunable to supply the demand. Still another woman stands out in her field as a\\ntrainer of dogs to lead the blind. Now she is training others to train dogs.\\nr enting equipment—If you own a vacuum cleaner, an electric washing machine\\nor ironer, an electric sewing machine, a sun lamp, a moving picture machine,\\nrent them for a small fee to your neighbors, when you are not using them. Be\\nsure to check your equipment carefully before you hand it over to anyone and\\ncheck it again when it is returned.\\nC ompiLe Lists for maiLing houses—Most of the companies which compile mailing\\nlists are interested in specific lists, such as well-to-do residents, farmers,\\nprospective brides, fruit growers, poultry raisers, newborn infants, etc. The\\nsame lists of names and addresses may be sold to several firms. General lists\\nare also of interest to these concerns from time to time.\\nC Lipping serviCe—Undoubtedly, there are individuals and companies in your\\nlocality which are more or less in the limelight. People like to know what is\\nbeing said about them. To operate a clipping service, notify these people or\\ncompanies that an item has appeared in such and such a newspaper recently.\\nExplain to them that they may have a copy by sending you twenty-five cents.\\nGive your clipping bureau a name that is dignified. Subscribe to some of thebetter-known newspapers and secure others from the second-hand magazine\\nshops, from the editor of your local paper, or buy the unsold newspapers from\\nyour news dealer.\\np Lan gardens—If you know how to grow plants and flowers, and have an eye\\nfor arrangement of color and form, help people plan their gardens. If you will\\nlook about at your neighbors’ gardens you will see that many of them are hit-\\nor-miss propositions. Draw up a plan on paper, indicating the most attractive\\narrangements for shrubs, flowers, trees, etc. Show how the garden will grow\\nin beauty from year to year and the future changes to be made in it. When\\nyour plan is complete, call on the garden owner and show him the plans. Be\\ncareful not to belittle his present planting; sell him on the idea of making his\\ngarden even more beautiful than it is. Your plans should sell for about $1.00.\\nIf you are to superintend the plantings, then your charge should be higher.\\nConsult the garden magazines for planting ideas.\\nh ostess—If you have had a good social background, capitalize on it by\\nbecoming a hostess or an assistant to a hostess. Help arrange dinners, bridge\\nparties, literary or musical evenings. Plan decorations, menus, and\\nentertainment. Hotels, dude ranches, resorts, clubs, associations, steamship\\nlines, and others often need this sort of help. Individuals who entertain a great\\ndeal but lack a flair for this sort of thing are also prospects.\\np aCking assistant—Some people have a natural ability to pack things well. If\\nyou have this knack, have some cards printed and leave them with real estate\\noffices, storage warehouses, managers of apartment buildings, and mail them\\nto wealthy people that you know make many trips. Some families are more\\nthan willing to turn over to you the entire job of packing when they leave on\\nsummer vacations, when they move to another city, or when they go abroad.\\nAnother job that ties up with this work is to close and open summer homes,\\nto close and open homes in the city for those on trips abroad. This may\\ninclude storing valuable silver, pictures, or china and preventing moth\\ndamages to furs and woolen garments.\\ne staBLish a LaundrY agenCY—Many women have developed a good business\\nhandling an agency for a laundry. Often the laundry company furnishes livingquarters behind the laundry office and pays in addition a flat salary each\\nmonth. If the agent is aggressive and endeavors to secure additional business,\\nhe can make arrangements for a commission on all new business. Some\\nagents also handle the ironing of fine table linens or silk wearing apparel\\nwhich cannot be ironed by machines.\\nmuLtigraph operators—If you have ever done any multigraphing work or it is\\neasy for you to learn simple operations such as this, get a second-hand\\nmultigraphing machine and advertise your service. There are any number of\\noffices, clubs, and institutions, which use multigraph work from time to time\\nduring the year. Make a canvass of your town and you will soon have enough\\nwork to keep you busy several hours a day.\\nfood demonstrator—Many manufacturers in the food field hire women to\\ndemonstrate their foods in retail stores. This work pays well and is easy for\\nthe woman who likes to meet people, can talk well and is neat and healthy\\nlooking.\\nfree LanCe seCretarY—Often small business firms cannot afford a full-time\\nstenographer or secretary. Build up your list by calling on the small firms\\nlocated in office buildings in your town. Doctors and dentists and sometimes\\nministers also have a need of such services. You may also secure work from\\nsociety women in your town. A social secretary is rather rare in small towns,\\nso there should be considerable work for an enterprising woman who can\\ndevote a few hours a day to such clients. A portable typewriter is a necessity\\nin this work. By selling a line of business stationery, in your spare time, you\\ncan earn enough to pay for a typewriter. Or, if you prefer, you can rent a\\ntypewriter.\\nnursing—As the average home finds it too expensive to engage the services of\\na trained nurse, practical nurses are in great demand. Nearly any woman can\\nlearn to perform the duties of a practical nurse. These duties include\\nmassaging, bathing, preparing the food of the patient, and following the usual\\norders of the doctor. You should register with doctors in your neighborhood,\\nnurses’ registries, clinics, and hospitals. It is well to let the merchants in your\\nneighborhood know that you can handle cases— frequently they are asked torecommend someone. Your town may have a branch of the Red Cross which\\noffers training. It is a good idea to take this training, as it may be of help to\\nyou in securing work.\\nk nitting instruCtion—The proprietor of many a neighborhood knitting shop often\\nfinds herself with too much work for one pair of hands. Every beginner, of\\ncourse, wants immediate attention. The woman who is an expert at knitting\\ncan sell her services to the proprietors of these little shops in and around her\\nneighborhood. While the owner of a shop may not need a full-time assistant,\\nshe may be glad to have an expert come in for two or three hours a day to\\nhelp her. Go around to the shops in your neighborhood and find out when\\nthey have their busiest hours. Then suggest to the proprietor that she pay you\\nso much an hour for instruction work during the busy period. Some shops are\\nopen certain evenings in the week and you can supplement your afternoon\\nwork in one shop with evening work in another. Some shops may require\\nyour services two or three afternoons a week; some two or three evenings.\\nCharge for your services by the hour and then if you are needed for an extra\\nhour or half hour over your usual time, your remuneration can be easily\\nfigured.\\nt eLephone serviCe—Professional men, especially doctors, require someone to\\nanswer the telephone when they are out on calls. This type of service is often\\nreferred to as a Doctors’ Telephone Service. Through arrangements with the\\nlocal telephone company calls for those on your service list are transferred to\\nyou and you take the messages for your clients. The client arranges to call\\nyou at certain intervals to pick up the messages if any have been received.\\nThere may be a service of this type in your town, but like many such\\nspecialized services, there is usually room for another one. The telephone\\ncompany will give you the necessary information regarding costs of\\noperation and method of operation.\\nchapter eleVen\\nPAYING FOR A COLLEGE EDUCATION\\nTHE lives of many of today’s business leaders were shaped by what they did\\nin college to pay for their education. The interest thus developed by a student\\noften became the foundation for his future career. Sometimes young people,\\nfaced with the necessity of paying their own way through school, have\\nuncovered latent ability as salesmen and have stepped out of college into\\nsales positions with large corporations. Others have worked on college papers\\nand thus become interested in editorial work and journalism. Still others have\\nshown marked ability as promoters, managing the affairs of their college\\nfootball or baseball teams.\\nFor that reason it is highly desirable that every opportunity be given students\\nto develop their money-making tendencies. No matter what work a person\\nmay do after leaving college, this experience in dealing with human nature\\nand persuading people to act on sales suggestions will prove invaluable. The\\nknack of meeting people on an equal basis and the ability to express oneself\\nclearly and concisely, thus acquired, remain long after school days are\\nforgotten.\\nMore important is the fact that a boy or girl, who has to earn money while\\ngetting the advantages of an education, acquires an appreciation of the value\\nof money that is most important in the building of character. It is a credit to\\nour American social system that the young man or woman who works his\\nway through school is respected and admired. It is generally true, also, that\\nthose who do work to pay for their schooling get more out of college than the\\nrich man’s son or daughter who is provided with all the money needed for\\nexpenses.\\nThere are, of course, the conventional ways of earning money to pay\\nexpenses, such as waiting on tables, coaching backward students, helping in\\nthe school library or office, clerking in a local store, doing a column for the\\nlocal newspaper, etc. It is possible to make sufficient money doing any one of\\nthese things to pay expenses during the school years. However, the greatest\\nopportunities to make money lie in the unusual type of work. What this work\\nmay be depends, of course, upon the community in which the school is\\nlocated, the natural aptitude of the student, and the opportunities which the\\nversatile student can develop.For example, one young man paid his way through Purdue University by\\nselling jewelry. He was so successful that after graduating he was given a\\nsales position with the manufacturer and is now on his way to becoming sales\\nmanager of the company. Another student in the same college hit upon the\\nidea of publishing a school calendar. This calendar was similar to a poster,\\nwith space in the center for listing the school events of the month. The\\nadvertising space around this central portion was sold to the local merchants\\nin the community. The placards were posted in every place frequented by\\nstudents. The revenue from the advertising paid for the printing of the posters\\nand yielded a profit large enough to pay the greater part of the student’s\\ntuition and living expenses.\\nSeveral years ago at Ames, two engineering students, faced with the necessity\\nof earning money to pay their expenses, organized a boarding club. Many\\nstudents were renting rooms where meals were not available and\\nconsequently were eating around at little lunchrooms. These two students saw\\nthe possibility of providing meals and looked about for a place suitable for\\nthe enterprise.\\nA woman in town who rented rooms in her home to students, but who\\nprovided no meals, was willing to rent her large dining-room to the club and\\nalso to provide space in her basement for food supplies. Each Friday, the two\\nboys figured up their expenses for the week, added their charges for\\nadministration, and then assessed each member of the club his proportionate\\nshare of the expense. Included in the expenses were the wages of two women\\nwho prepared the meals. Two students waited on the tables for their meals.\\nThe total cost was kept down by buying all groceries wholesale and watching\\nfor special bargains. About thirty students were served at each meal—all the\\nroom would accommodate.\\nThe meals were simple, but good, and as the cost was less than at other\\nboarding places, the club always had its full quota of members. Both boys\\nwere on their toes and never missed an opportunity to sell the club idea to\\nnew students. Of course, the student rooming houses in the vicinity were\\nsolicited for members.In order to promote interest in the club, the boys ran a lottery for a season\\nticket to the home football games and a separate lottery for the most\\nimportant out-of-town game of the season.\\nTaking Pictures in the Street Pays College Expenses\\nA\\nN AMATEUR interest in photography—a hobby with Harold Walker for\\nseveral years—became the means of making enough money during vacations\\nto pay expenses during his last two years in college. The new type camera\\nWalker uses operates on the motion picture principle taking clear, sharp\\nphotographs at high speed. Walker straps on this camera so that it is held\\nrigidly against his chest, leaving both hands free. Its focus is fixed for any\\ndistance, and its exposure limited to 1/250 of a second, eliminating the\\ndanger of bad photographs from lack of exposure or wrong focus adjustment.\\nThus any amateur can secure good results.\\nGetting some cards printed and numbered, Walker took his camera to a busy\\nstreet corner and snapped photographs of everyone entering the range of his\\nlens. To each he handed a coin card on which was printed: “Your photograph\\nhas just been taken. Send this card and twenty-five cents to Harold Walker\\nand prints will be mailed to you.” Between ten o’clock in the morning and\\nfour in the afternoon, Walker photographed about three hundred persons, and\\nwithin a few days received one hundred and fourteen cards with silver\\nquarters from these people. His average cost for each person photographed\\nwas slightly over two cents. There is no reason why you could not do as well.\\nA simple system is used for determining the right photograph for each card.\\nThe first three numbers of the card indicate the week of the month, the day of\\nthe week, and the month in which the exposure was made. The last numbers\\nindicate the number of the photograph itself. The lowest number for each day\\nis the number for the first exposure; the next number represents the second\\nexposure, and so on. Thus, number 15637 would be the number of the thirty-\\nseventh person photographed on the fifth day of the first week in June. It is\\neasy to keep the exposures in rotation when cutting the film after the film isdeveloped.\\nThe total investment Walker made to get started, including the cost of the\\ncamera, was $135. He does his own printing, but has the negatives developed\\nunder an inexpensive arrangement at a local studio. There are few days, he\\ndeclares, when he does not make ten dollars or more with his camera.\\nYou can use a camera of this type anywhere, on the street, at beaches,\\nsummer camps, fairs, carnivals and even along highways, and make a good\\nprofit from a few hours’ work. It is not necessary to have experience handling\\na camera to get good results, since the entire operation consists of pushing a\\nbutton.\\nVenetian Blinds Provide School Money\\nP\\nERHAPS you have noticed that Venetian blinds are quite the thing these\\ndays and that they are being widely used in private homes, as well as in\\npublic institutions and business offices. This type of window shade has a big\\nadvantage over the usual roll blind, in that it admits the light and air while\\nkeeping out the sun. Robert Peterson, who had taken a manual training course\\nin the Nicholas Senn High School, Chicago, wanted to make enough money\\nduring his summer vacation to finance his first year in college. Observing this\\ngrowing demand for Venetian blinds, which it seemed to him could be easily\\nmade, he decided to go into the business. He bought a scroll saw, drill press,\\nspray gun and a few other tools, purchased a supply of wooden slats from a\\nmill that specialized in them and did some experimenting. The only difficulty\\nhe had was getting a cord that would operate properly in the shade. He tried\\nseveral different kinds of cord until he found that Italian hemp gave the\\ndesired results. He also had trouble at first getting a suitable tape, but an\\nuncle in the furniture manufacturing business made inquiry, and finding that\\nthe best tape came from England, arranged to get him a supply. While the\\ntape was coming over, Robert made a canvass of the homes in his locality\\nand succeeded in booking enough orders for shades to keep him busy all\\nsummer. He found that small factories were especially good prospects, asmost of them needed blinds which would keep out the sun but let in the light\\nand air.\\nMarthaHopkins’Exchange HelpsPayTuition\\nA\\nLTHOUGH fifty-five years old, Martha Hopkins was a youthful, active\\nperson—one who had never lost her zest for adventure. She figured she might\\nhave a chance to make enough money to help pay her niece’s college tuition\\nby starting a woman’s exchange in the “second best” parlor. As she belonged\\nto the Woman’s Club, was active in church work, attended lectures,\\ncommunity meetings, and was well known in her community, it wasn’t long\\nbefore everyone in that part of town knew about her “Exchange.”\\nFor the sale of her neighbors’ antiques, she received a commission of 25 per\\ncent. In some cases when a customer lacked the ready cash, Martha Hopkins\\nwould accept a piece of furniture, a picture or something else of value, which\\ntogether with a small sum of money, would pay for the coveted item. There\\nwas much bargaining, but Mrs. Hopkins was a “born” trader. The\\n“Exchange” soon began to pay and if you asked her why she succeeded she\\nwould answer: “Well, I guess I just like to sell—and I like to buy, too. Then,\\nof course, I know so many people; my father, you know, was a pioneer in this\\nsection of town. He was a doctor, so we came to know about every old family\\naround these parts. But I believe the real reason is that everyone has\\nsomething he doesn’t want which someone else would like to have. This is\\nreally just swapping—and swapping is as much fun for grown-ups as for\\nyoungsters.”\\nFive Dollars a Day Stenciling House\\nNumbersonCurbstones\\nB\\nACK in 1937 it looked as if two students, Ralph and George, at NorthwesternUniversity (Evanston, Illinois), would be unable to return for their fourth year\\nunless some unknown source of revenue could be tapped—and, as they\\nagreed, “the sooner the better.” It was Ralph who got the bright idea for\\nmaking money one evening when calling on his latest “big moment.” Two\\npeople in a car stopped in front of the house where he was calling and\\ninquired whether it was such and such a number. After he had directed them,\\nhe realized that you simply could not see the house number from the curb.\\nThat night when he got back to the room he shared with George, they put\\ntheir heads together and after some plain and fancy figuring found they could\\nmake a tidy sum of money by painting house numbers on the curbstones in\\nfront of the houses of Evanstonians, with a set of marking stencils.\\nEach boy took one side of the street. In front of a house one of the boys\\nwould brush a square of white paint on the curb and then ring the doorbell.\\nWhen the householder appeared the white space was pointed out, and he was\\nasked if he wouldn’t like to see his house number painted in black on the\\nwhite space. It is surprising how many were actually eager to have the job\\ndone. In fact, about three-quarters of the householders of Evanston had house\\nnumbers painted on their curbstones before the boys had finished.\\nThe white spaces were painted first along the street and then the boys came\\nback and stenciled the black numbers thus allowing time for the white paint\\nto dry. A charge of twenty-five cents was made for any combination of\\nnumbers and the first morning in four hours they completed twenty-two\\norders each, making a total of $5.50 for the morning’s work a piece.\\nEvery Saturday and as many hours before and after classes as they could\\nmanage these two enterprising “business men” worked at their jobs. Before\\nlong they found that they had about exhausted the market in Evanston. They\\nthen moved on to the section just south of Evanston which is Chicago proper\\nand worked that territory. When that was worked out they moved on to other\\nsuburbs north and “numbered” the residents as Ralph termed it. During the\\nspring vacation they finished the sections north and west of Evanston and\\nwhen the summer vacation came around they decided to take their paint and\\nbrushes and “number the natives” along the route to Ralph’s home where\\nGeorge was spending the summer. In the farm sections along the way theypainted rural mail boxes with aluminum paint and stenciled the name, post\\noffice, R.F.D. route, and box number. For this work a charge of fifty cents\\nwas made. During the summer they worked the territory, in and around\\nRalph’s home town of 150,000 people and the fall term saw them with more\\nthan enough money to finish their fourth year’s tuition.\\nThere’s a Good Market for Sports Pictures“\\nG\\nUESS I’m lucky,” replied Aaron Rubino, San Mateo (California) Junior\\nCollege “frosh” when asked how he had succeeded so well with the side line\\nto his premedical course. A smiling, black-haired giant of nineteen, Rube, as\\nhe is known, takes pictures with a Graflex plate camera—pictures that sell.\\nPhotography always interested him but it became his hobby in 1935\\nwhen he was given a photo finishing outfit. He went to football games and\\nsnapped highlight plays. One Saturday on the field he asked a photographer\\nfor help in getting a picture. The man was star camera man for the San\\nFrancisco Chronicle. He not only gave the advice but told Rube to come to\\nthe office any time he needed information. Rube did, a friendship developed,\\nand today that newspaper man is a friend of the Rubino family.\\nThe boy spent every spare moment taking and developing pictures. He was\\ngetting orders. He specialized in athletic subjects because he was so “keen”\\nabout sports.\\nOne day he showed some pictures to the sports editor of the Chronicle who\\naccepted them and offered to buy others as good. Rube submitted them by the\\ndozen, gaining the liking of the editorial staff by his perseverance and\\nenthusiasm. He was given use of the dark room and the benefit of expert\\nadvice. At first he supplied his own films and paid his way to photographed\\nevents—many times wasted effort when his photos didn’t sell. But today he\\nrarely has a failure and the newspaper gives him assignments and pays for\\nfilms in addition to pictures used. He has a press badge, gets free passes to all\\nathletic events, and knows practically every newspaperman in town.\\nBeing “with the staff but not of it” is an advantage, he points out. The free\\nlance can sell prints and retain his negative, something a staff photographer\\ncannot do. Rube sells to the United Press, Associated Press, Wide World, and\\nother good markets. Here are his suggestions to prospective free lance cameramen:\\nAlways be on time. He learned this when, after watching a school fire from\\ntwelve until three in the morning, he rushed home to develop his pictures and\\ngot them to the Chronicle by four o’clock only to be told “Too late; we’ve\\ngone to press.”\\nDon’t be afraid to talk to people. He often hitch-hikes the nineteen miles\\nhome from college because he likes to contact people and has had “lifts” in\\neverything from a Ford to a Packard. “It’s a swell way to learn human\\nnature,” he declares.\\nBe resourceful. Resourcefulness brought him his biggest thrill and a scoop.\\nAt college one morning he heard that a “red” demonstration was to be staged\\non the campus at high noon. What a chance for pictures! But, alas, his camera\\nwas at home. Attending morning classes he wrestled with the problem of\\ngetting those pictures and when the demonstration came off there was Rube\\nin the thick of it clicking away. He had borrowed the school camera. He\\nrecorded the wild scene with eggs and tomatoes by the bushel flying through\\nthe air hitting policemen and college dignitaries who were trying to quell the\\ndisorder. Rube was the only photographer present and the rioters tried to\\nsmash him and his camera but he got away and rushed down to the Chronicle\\noffice. Other newspapers tried to buy his pictures but he wouldn’t sell and the\\nChronicle was the only paper carrying photographs to accompany the big\\nheadlined story.\\nSaid Rube: “I just fought my way through the mob. Guess it was luck.”\\nLuck? Sounds more like pluck.\\nMaking College Expenses with an IceCreamMachine\\nW\\nHEN Lucy Manners discovered that no arrangement had been made for\\nsupplying ice cream to the girls in a camp where she was spending her\\nsummer vacation from college, she bought a hand-operated ice creammachine. Her investment in this machine was a little under fifty dollars. This\\nincluded cost of transportation and incidental equipment. It was large enough\\nto make ten gallons of ice cream at one time. With the machine she received\\ndetailed instructions on operating it and on making various kinds of cream.\\nShe set the machine up in a tent. Then she visited a near-by town and ordered\\nthe required amount of ice and supplies. She bought milk from a farmer and\\nmade up the first ten gallons of ice cream.\\n“I thought the girls would like a rich vanilla cream best,” said Lucy, “but I\\nwas surprised to learn most of them preferred chocolate flavor. So I made ten\\ngallons of the vanilla and ten gallons of the chocolate that first day. There\\nwere two hundred and sixty girls in the camp, all between the ages of fifteen\\nand twenty-two. And all wanted ice cream. But twenty gallons were more\\nthan they seemed willing to consume in one day. It took two days to sell it.”\\nLucy sold her cream in cones at five cents each, getting five hundred and fifty\\ncones for the ten gallons of ice cream. Each girl in the camp bought an\\naverage of two cones daily. Her profits from ice cream sales averaged\\nthirteen dollars and sixty cents daily and during the hundred days she spent at\\nthe summer camp she made a profit well over a thousand dollars—a welcome\\ncontribution toward her college expenses.\\n“One really hot day I had to make thirty gallons of cream. I had to work\\nrather hard, but I was thrilled at the money I made. That was my biggest day.\\nIt was a visiting day in the camp, and some boys came over from a boys’\\ncamp about twenty miles away during the afternoon. Many of the girls’\\nparents had come up there too, so I did quite a good business.” The cost of\\nmaking a gallon of cream, including the ice, milk, extracts, and other\\ningredients, Lucy found to be sixty-four cents. Cones cost one dollar for each\\nthree hundred.\\nA machine such as Lucy used may be operated by anyone, and there are\\nalmost unlimited opportunities for making money with it. In small towns an\\nice-cream machine may be made to pay for itself many times over if placed in\\na store, or near a school, or on a business street.Students Earn Money as Proxy Parents\\nA\\nBOUT two years ago, Miss G. Alison Raymond, a graduate of Bryn Mawr,\\nfound it impossible to locate anything other than a temporary job. After\\nweeks of unsuccessful scouting she realized that she would have to make her\\nown job. Making a job is, of course, much more difficult than finding one.\\nHowever, Miss Raymond’s special aptitude for organization has enabled her\\nto make an unusual success in an out-of-the-ordinary enterprise she calls\\nProxy Parents.\\n“Proxy Parents” provides employment for young students who find it\\nnecessary to make money during odd hours. These “proxy parents” are on\\ncall any time during the day and evening. For instance, if Mrs. Jones’ little\\ndaughter is coming home from school or camp and the mother cannot meet\\nthe train, she calls Proxy Parents and a student is called to take over the job of\\nseeing that Priscilla reaches home safely. Or, if a mother has a convalescent\\nchild and wants someone to amuse him, read to him or play games with him,\\nshe calls “Proxy Parents.”\\nBesides meeting trains, amusing convalescent children in their homes or in\\nhospitals, Proxy Parents will take charge of play hours during rainy days,\\ntake children singly or in groups to museums, the moving pictures, beaches,\\nplaygrounds, parks, or other specified places. Students are also on call for an\\nhour or two to stay with a child while the mother shops, or they will take\\ncharge of a child during the evenings when the parents are away.\\nA clever girl whose course of study is not too heavy could develop such an\\nenterprise during her third and fourth college years with the idea of\\ncontinuing it after graduation. A card file of students names, free hours, and\\nspecial abilities, and a list of families in town having children, form the basis\\nfor a “proxy parent” business.\\nCollar Specialty Pays ProfitsW\\nHEN Al Handler, a student at Northwestern University, Evanston, decided to\\nmake some extra money on his vacation, he elected to sell a device that\\nmakes soft collars set properly. In his vacation period he earned well over\\n$1,000 selling them. That’s a remarkable achievement when you consider he\\nwas selling a 25-cent item.\\n“This specialty certainly appealed to me,” declared Handler. “Wearing soft-\\ncollard shirts myself, I recognized the disadvantage of the soft collar. It didn’t\\nlook as neat and snappy as the starched collar. Often the soft collars on my\\nown shirts were messy, uneven in appearance, and in hot weather, wrinkled\\nvery easily. So when I found out about this little wire device that makes soft\\ncollars behave, I fell for it hard. I got a gross of them. I called upon men of\\nmy own age at first, made a quick demonstration, and usually got their\\nmoney. Still, it took quite a while to sell the gross. Sometimes I wouldn’t\\nmake more than two sales in an hour, and that wasn’t much, for on a 50-cent\\nsale my commission amounted to only 35 cents. It was plain that I had to\\nincrease the number of sales, and increase them quickly, to make the money I\\nneeded.\\n“I tried calling on pool rooms, barber shops, and similar places, often to find\\nbut one or two men inside—not enough to step up sales appreciably. Where\\ncould I go and do a better business? That became my dominating idea. I went\\nto a baseball park one afternoon, an hour before the game started. Here were\\nthousands of men. If I could sell only a few of them, I thought I could get\\nsomewhere. So I talked with a couple of men in the grandstand, made a few\\nsales, then I moved to another part of the grandstand, and made a few more\\nsales. In that one afternoon, I sold a hundred and fourteen of these wire\\ngadgets to make soft collars set right, and pocketed $19.95 in commissions. I\\ncalled back at the ball park the next day, and made better than ninety sales.\\nThe following day, I didn’t do so well. I next tried the bathing beaches, where\\nI was sure to find a number of men sitting around in their shirt sleeves. In two\\nhours I sold thirty-five, and left the beach highly elated. I was convinced. I\\nwas getting somewhere. My problem, however, was to find some place every\\nday where there would be a crowd of men. Once in the crowd, I would beable to do a brisk business. This brought me to all parts of the city. I sold lay-\\nright devices even in hotel lobbies.\\n“Some men asked me for my card. Some took two or three of the devices at\\none time. Many turned me down, of course. But out of every forty men I\\nspoke to, I was able to sell ten. It was easy to talk to a great many men who\\nremained in a place like a ball park or at the beach for several hours, and get\\ntheir yes or no answer. I was careful to avoid any kind of group\\ndemonstration, however. I didn’t want to give the impression that I was\\nmaking a soap box demonstration. I wasn’t a hawker, crying out my wares. I\\nspoke to men in a quiet way, told them to look at the way my collar lay, and\\nmade a quick demonstration. That was all.”\\nHandler received some business from men who asked for his card. One such\\nprospect, a big-league catcher at that time for the New York Giants. He took\\nhalf a dozen of Handler’s devices and told the other men on the team about\\nthem. Several sent their orders on to Handler from New York later.\\nMrs.Fenton’sCannedVegetable Business\\nB\\nY THE time her daughter was almost ready to enter college, Mrs. R. W.\\nFenton, of Lynn County, Texas, began to realize that with the low prices for\\nfarm crops there might not be enough money for the four years at school.\\nBut, as the old saying goes, where there’s a will there’s a way, and, when the\\ntime came, the money was there each year of the four to pay the expenses.\\nMrs. Fenton made that money by canning vegetables. Experience in home\\ndemonstration club work had enabled her to produce a high-grade product\\nand she had gained the privilege of using official demonstration labels on her\\ncanned goods. One of her big orders came from the Texas A & M College to\\nwhich she had submitted samples of canned peas. This order was for use in\\nthe college dining halls and consisted of 1,000 No. 3 cans. Another order\\nfrom the school was for 300 No. 2 cans of peas and a dormitory at Texas\\nTechnological College purchased 100 No. 3 and 200 No. 2 cans of black-eyed peas. Another of her regular customers was a large hotel in Lubbock\\nwhich bought her canned products for banquets and other special occasions.\\nAll the members of the family took a hand in preparing the goods for market\\nby helping to gather, clean and prepare the vegetables for canning. Two large\\npressure cookers were used in canning, one accommodating nine No. 3 cans\\nand the other fifteen No. 3’s. In one day, with the aid of the family, Mrs.\\nFenton put up 150 No. 3 and 200 No. 2 cans of vegetables. The canning\\nseason lasts about eight weeks and while the Fenton kitchen was a busy place\\nduring that time, careful planning of the work and kitchen arrangement has\\nsimplified the job considerably. By planting the vegetables at two-week\\nintervals, sufficient time elapsed between the maturing of each crop to allow\\nfor a smooth flow of work in the kitchen.\\nWhile many of the vegetables were raised under field conditions, most of\\nthem were grown in a subirrigated home garden. The subirrigation was\\nnecessary because of a mineral deposit in the soil which made it impossible\\nto farm after several years of surface irrigation. The simple subirrigation\\nmethod consisted of three lines of homemade concrete tiles which cost one\\ncent a foot, exclusive of labor, a windmill and water tank, and a hose. The\\nwindmill pumped the water into the overhead tank and gravitation forced it\\ndown through the hose where it enters the intakes of the tiles. Watering for\\ntwo or three hours once a week was sufficient to moisten the soil unless the\\nweather became extremely hot.\\nAs the market for Mrs. Fenton’s products grew, the money earned was more\\nthan sufficient for her daughter’s use. There was even enough left over to buy\\nsome of the labor-saving devices most women want in their homes.\\n“Pinch Hitting” for Housewives Solves CollegeProblem\\nJ\\nEANNETTE HARDY had her heart set on going to college. Before she\\nentered high school, she had her plans all made to study home economics\\nwith the idea of teaching the subject when she finished college. But her aunt,while able to see her through high school, could not afford to send Jeannette\\nto college.\\nWhen Jeannette was still in grade school she was saving the money she made\\nrunning errands and doing small household tasks. However, her specialty was\\ncooking and she decided to become a past master of this art. By the time she\\nentered high school she was able to prepare excellent meals. She found a\\nfield for her talent in preparing dinners for the “cliff dwellers” in her\\nneighborhood who liked to play bridge or golf in the afternoons. The night\\nbefore her engagement, she would call her “client” on the telephone and get a\\nlist of the things needed for dinner the next night. On her way home from\\nschool at three-thirty, she would do the marketing.\\nWhen she arrived at her employer’s home and got the key from the janitor,\\nshe would wash up the luncheon or breakfast dishes, prepare the vegetables\\nand the dessert, and set the table. While the dinner was cooking she would\\nstraighten up the dining and living rooms, picking up the scattered\\nnewspapers and books, emptying the ash trays, plumping up the cushions,\\nsetting the window shades straight, and giving the rooms the attention that\\nevery good housekeeper knows makes a place look right. If a roast had been\\nselected for the evening meal it would be in the oven, but if steak or chops,\\nshe would have them ready to pop into the broiler as soon as she heard her\\nemployer’s key in the door. In twenty minutes or so, she would be ready to\\nserve the dinner. Then after dinner, she washed the dishes and tidied up the\\nkitchen. Her charge for this service was $1.25. When she didn’t have to do\\nthe marketing, the charge was $1.00.\\nShe started out with one “customer” a week. Then she added two more to her\\nlist. In the meantime, she helped prepare food and serve it at several big\\nparties. During the school year she averaged about four engagements a week.\\nIn the second summer vacation from school she spent one month taking\\ncomplete charge of an invalid who needed to have her food carefully\\nprepared. The family in this case paid the girl $15 a week. Whereas the first\\nyear in high school she had made only $150, the second year she made $200.\\nThese sums added to the $150 she had in her college fund made a total of\\n$500 when she entered her third year in high school. In the next two yearsshe was able to set aside $400. At Christmas time and other holidays, she\\nearned some extra money by preparing and selling coffee cakes, plum\\npuddings, fruit cake, and similar delicacies. Upon her graduation, her savings\\nmade it possible for her to be certain of at least two years in college without\\nscrimping or missing any of the social activities. At the end of her first two\\ncollege years, an insurance policy her aunt had taken out when Jeannette was\\na little girl, fell due and provided a sufficient sum to pay for the two\\nremaining years.\\nA College Education from Walnuts\\nO\\nN A FARM just outside a small town in Missouri, lived Mrs. Harris, a\\nwidow, with one daughter in college. Money was scarce as it usually is on\\nfarms. One day Mrs. Harris noticed that the walnut trees were loaded with\\nnuts. Perhaps, she thought, they could be sold. The next day she had the boy\\nwho did odd jobs around the farm gather a couple of bushels of the walnuts\\nand they were spread out to dry in the sun. Later when they were dry, he\\ncracked them and she picked out the nut meats and carefully separated them\\nfrom the shells.\\nIn the meantime she had written a sister in Chicago and asked her whether\\nthere was any demand for black walnuts in Chicago. The sister replied at\\nonce that she could sell about ten pounds to two candy firms located not far\\nfrom her immediate neighborhood and quoted the price the firms wanted to\\npay. She also suggested another ten pounds which she believed could be sold\\nto friends and acquaintances. The thirty pounds were mailed by parcel post\\nand the two ten-pound lots delivered to the candy factories. At her bridge\\nclub the sister served a cake baked with some of the walnuts and mentioned\\nthe fact that the walnuts came from her sister’s farm. That was the start of a\\nnice little business. The walnuts were also put up in little cellophane bags and\\nsold somewhat higher than the general market price. The daughter at college\\nalso helped. She induced a local store catering to the fudge-loving college\\nstudents to try a tenpound package and she secured an order from an icecream manufacturer. A candy shop that made a variety of candy known as\\n“black walnut kisses” also ordered a ten-pound package. Word got around the\\ncollege town and soon orders came to the girl from the mothers of some of\\nthe local college students. The walnuts were mailed from home in ten-pound\\npackages and she put them up in cellophane bags as her aunt in Chicago had\\ndone.\\nThe sister in Chicago was a “live wire.” She called upon bakeries and upon\\nconfectioners, upon local specialty food shops, and soon had worked up a\\ngood list of customers. Many of these firms ordered direct because they\\nwanted to secure larger quantities and correspondingly lower prices. Others\\ncontinued to purchase their needs locally from the sister.\\nWhy do not more farm families do this sort of thing? And why do not more\\ncity folks who would like to make a thousand dollars, arrange with people\\nliving on farms to market the particularly fine things they grow? A young\\nman in Winnetka, Illinois, made a tidy sum of money taking orders for\\nCalifornia figs which he cleared through a fig grower in the Santa Clara\\nValley. A chap in Atlanta earned well over a thousand dollars last year by\\nselling Florida Key limes to local soda fountains and fancy grocery stores. He\\nsecured limes grown on Captiva Island just off Fort Myers. Any number of\\nfancy food products, such as these, can be sold at a nice profit by anyone who\\nis not afraid of work.\\nEarns Tuition by Polishing Cars\\nO\\nNE Saturday afternoon, E. A. Huntley was busily washing his car in\\n“gasoline alley,” when a young chap came up to him and said: “I believe that\\ncar would look better if it were simonized.” Huntley agreed. “It certainly\\nwould, but it costs about $5.00 or $6.00 and I don’t feel like spending that\\nmuch right now.” The young man produced an inexpensive card on which\\nwas printed in the center the one word “Simonizing.” In the lower left-hand\\ncorner was his name, address and telephone number.“I will simonize your car for you for only $3.00, and I will do a real good job.\\nRight now I’m working on your neighbor’s car just down the alley a bit. I am\\na student in Washington University and have Saturdays and Sundays free, of\\ncourse. Would next Saturday morning be O.K. to work on your car?”\\nThere was no question that the car did need polishing and the chap was so\\nengaging in his manners—so Huntley told him to come around next Saturday\\nmorning and he could have the job. Then he became curious about the boy’s\\nwork. “Do you have many jobs such as this?” he asked. “Yes, I do,” the\\nstudent replied. “Every Saturday and Sunday I have jobs and also throughout\\nthe week, during my free time. I would say that I average at least a car a day.\\nRight now I am in my junior year at Washington and I have paid my way so\\nfar, with the exception of the first term, by cleaning and polishing cars. I have\\nmy regular customers and they are always recommending me to their friends.\\nThat’s because I do such a good job,” he ingenuously added.\\n“But how did you build up your ‘clientele’?” asked Huntley. “Just the way I\\ngot the job to simonize your car,” answered the student, grinning. “I had\\nthese cards printed, went along the alleys and wherever I found a man\\ncleaning up his car, I would present my card and offer to do a good job on his\\ncar. Whenever I sold one man on the idea, I went to his neighbors and sold\\nthem. I also went around to the offices and factories. Whenever I saw a man\\ngetting into a car that looked like it needed polishing, I would step up and\\ngive him one of my cards and a little talk about the kind of job I can do. It\\nseems to work all right because I always have enough work to keep me busy\\nand, as a general rule, several jobs booked ahead.\\n“Well, I’ll have to get back to my job down the alley—I promised to have it\\nfinished by 4:30. I’ll leave a couple of my cards with you and if you have any\\nfriends who want their cars cleaned and polished, I’d appreciate it if you\\nwould let them know about my work. I’ll be around bright and early Saturday\\nmorning to do your car. Thank you sir, for the job. You’ll be surprised when\\nyou see how nice your car will look Saturday after it gets one of my good\\n‘rub-downs.’ ”\\nAs Huntley said to his wife later, “How could you turn down a polite,ambitious boy such as that and especially one with so much initiative?”\\nWooden Dogs Pay Student’s Expenses\\nA\\nYOUNG college student living in Webster Groves, Missouri, was, unlike\\nmost girls, interested in woodworking, and much of her spare time was spent\\nat her Dad’s work bench in the basement of her home. One day while\\nexperimenting with some thin pieces of wood and a scroll saw, she turned out\\nthe figure of a little Scottie. By attaching a pin to it she had a dress ornament.\\nWhen the girls at school saw it, they too, wanted one. So she made several\\nfor her friends and gave them away. However, the first thing she knew,\\nalmost everybody in her sorority wanted one of the cunning little wooden\\ndogs for a hat or scarf pin. She began to make all sorts of dogs, but the\\nScotties were the favorites. And she began to charge a small price for the\\npins. As the fad grew, she found that the shops wanted quantities of the pins,\\nso dad and brother and sister got together and began turning out dozens of the\\nornaments. Before long, the basement workshop was a regular little factory\\nand all hands were busily engaged.\\nThe fad grew and spread, and it wasn’t long before every girl on the campus\\nwas wearing a little wooden dog pin. And, incidentally, where before there\\nwas hardly enough money to pay for four years’ college expenses, now there\\nwas plenty and to spare. The fad for wooden ornaments, buttons, belt\\nbuckles, clip pins and even earrings, as well as for match holders, trays,\\ncandle holders and similar items, is still going strong and looks like it will\\nlast at least another season or two.\\nA Hundred and One Ways to Earn CollegeExpenses\\ns ports and games—Besides teaching swimming, tennis, golf, skiing, and other\\nsports, there is an opportunity for the student proficient in athletics to secure\\nwork coaching high school teams, to act as referee or umpire, to give\\ngymnastic instruction in clubs in the community, to manage a summer golfclub, act as assistant to a playground instructor, manage a skating rink, be an\\nathletic counselor at a summer camp, work as a life guard during the summer\\nmonths, organize athletic activities in clubs or churches. Naturally, those\\nstudents on football or other teams cannot accept such work for they would\\nlose their amateur standings and be barred from college athletics. Teaching\\nbridge offers another means of earning money.\\ntutoring and teaChing—Tutoring pays from 50 cents to around $1.50 an hour, and\\nif the student can find a sufficient number of jobs, he can make a nice little\\nincome. Many students enter college who need tutoring in special subjects in\\norder to fulfill the entrance requirements. The subjects in which most of them\\nneed help are: mathematics, foreign languages, physics, and English.\\nm usiC—Students with a musical education can often help to pay their\\nexpenses by giving music lessons to children and adults in the community.\\nThey may also be able to find part-time work in the local school of music\\nteaching voice, the violin, the piano and other instruments. Teaching hours\\ncan usually be arranged so that they do not interfere with the student’s regular\\nclass work. If you are a good organist, you may be able to secure the job of\\nchapel organist. Organize a college orchestra and sell your services to a\\nsummer resort, hotel, or other place of amusement. Many students find an\\nopportunity to play in a dance band over the week-ends. A few dollars can\\nalso be made by singing in a church choir.\\nAssistant Instructors—Students can arrange with the dean to secure work in\\nthe laboratories or the libraries. There is also an opportunity in work such as\\nthe correction of class papers, checking student attendance, the supervision of\\nmusic practice, etc. While this work does not pay much, it is worth securing\\nbecause it is right on the campus thus making it possible to sandwich in the\\nwork at odd moments.\\nt eaChing—Positions are often available in the local schools for advanced\\nstudents. These jobs usually pay well, but they are exacting and take more of\\nthe student’s time than some of the other activities by which he can earn\\nmoney. Some of the colleges employ student instructors in various\\ndepartments and the positions pay fairly well.C LeriCaL Work—This type of work may be secured in the school itself, in\\nlocal business houses, and in local retail stores. The student who has learned\\ntypewriting and shorthand is in a position to take advantage of such part-time\\njobs available. In addition to secretarial work, these jobs may include billing,\\nfiling, stencil cutting, mimeographing, addressing and mailing. The\\ncompensation ranges from 15 to 40 cents an hour, depending upon the labor\\nmarket, the community, and the importance of the work.\\ns eLLing Your serviCes—Reading to invalids; taking care of children; giving\\npatients massage; cleaning and pressing garments; mending; housework;\\ngardening; tending furnaces; window washing; waiting on tables; delivery\\nservice for stores; washing dishes; catering; janitor service in clubs, college\\ndormitories, and churches; shoveling snow; beating rugs; typewriting term\\npapers; chauffering; cutting grass; cleaning and polishing automobiles;\\ncaddying; delivering books from the libraries, and distributing circulars for\\nmerchants, all offer means of making money to pay expenses. In many\\ncolleges, student agencies have been organized to handle much of this sort of\\nwork. There are laundry agencies, boarding clubs, pressing and cleaning\\nagencies, travel agencies, news agencies, etc. When these agencies are well\\norganized and managed, they yield their promoters sufficient profit to pay\\ntuition as well as other expenses during the college years.\\nodd JoBs—Students are frequently able to secure part-time jobs with the local\\nice company, banks, lumber and coal yards, trucking companies,\\nmanufacturing plants, hotels, summer resorts, steamboat companies, garages,\\netc. Jobs with such concerns will include all sorts of work—food checkers,\\ntruck drivers, pursers, icemen, bell hops, freight handlers, auto mechanics,\\ntimekeepers, bank runners. In addition to being a means of earning expenses,\\nwork such as this often leads to full-time jobs with the company after\\ngraduation.\\nhandiCrafts—Those who are skillful with the needle, the saw, the paint brush,\\nor scissors, can often make quite a bit of money during the holidays by\\ncatering to the demand for handmade articles. Some of the articles that can be\\nmade and sold during the holiday season include: hand-knitted scarfs, ties,\\nand novelty gloves such as are worn for winter sports; cut-out silhouettes\\nwhich can be likenesses of students, historical figures, or pet dogs, cats,squirrels, etc.; hand-painted greeting cards; handmade handkerchiefs; collar\\nand cuff sets; monogram work; dolls; laundry and shoe bags; boutonnieres;\\ncloth or paper-covered scrapbooks; dress bags; bookstands; folding screens;\\nship or airplane models; photographs of points of interest on the campus;\\nhanging bookshelves, and cretonne or chintz cushions. These articles can be\\nsold direct to the students for their own use or as gifts for their families and\\nfriends; they may also be sold through the gift shops, the woman’s exchange,\\nor the student’s exchange.\\nConfeCtionerY—If someone in the family makes excellent candies, you can sell\\npounds of them to your fellow students. During the holidays, there is always\\na good demand. Butterscotch, molasses kisses, taffy, fudge, caramels, maple\\ncandy, peanut clusters made with a syrup coating, old-fashioned peppermint\\nsticks, candied fruits, stuffed dates or figs, “seafoam,” and coconut kisses, are\\nall popular.\\np romotions and ConCessions—Student agencies mentioned above come under this\\nclassification. There is also an opportunity to earn money by handling the\\nsale of souvenirs, jewelry, novelties, food, fruits, engraved cards and other\\nmerchandise on the campus. Student exchanges handling the sale of\\nhandicrafts and art work offer a good return for the time invested. These and\\nother unusual promotions are generally operated by upper classmen and\\nrequire both initiative and executive ability.\\nfarm and garden Work—Students attending college in agricultural sections often\\nsecure their room and board as well as wages during the summer months by\\nhelping with the milking, care of poultry or live stock, picking fruit,\\nthreshing, stacking wheat, shucking corn, and other farm activities.\\nAgricultural colleges also offer students work in the truck gardens and the\\ngreenhouses on the campus. Agricultural experiment stations pay students for\\nspecial technical work.\\ntrades andprofessions—The man who is proficient in some trade can often secure\\nwork in his particular line which pays well. Radio repair work, barbering,\\nautomobile repair work, making blue prints, typesetting, electrical appliance\\nrepairs, finishing photographs, woodturning, carpentry, watch repairing, andother work of this type is often available. Girls frequently earn money enough\\nfor board and room rent by giving shampoos, cutting hair, giving facials and\\nmanicures.\\ns eLLing—Many companies are glad to secure the sale of their products\\nthrough college students and many a boy or girl has secured a college\\neducation through the money earned by selling. Among the dozens of items\\nthat have been sold by students—and are still being sold—are: hosiery,\\njewelry, magazines, candy, greeting cards, books, electrical appliances,\\naluminum cooking utensils, nursery stock, insurance, coal, notions, novelties,\\nfire extinguishers, eggs and poultry, advertising, calendars, cosmetics,\\ndisinfectants, pen and pencil sets, Neon signs, gas savers, auto club\\nmemberships, lubricants, clocks, brushes, lingerie, men’s suits, shirts, etc.\\nJournaLism—Students of journalism find a field for their activities and a way to\\nearn money by reporting for local and metropolitan newspapers. This work is\\npaid for by the inch. Generally the student does not have to write his material,\\nbut telephones it in to the paper. Gifted students can often write special\\narticles well enough for publication. The college publications also offer an\\nopportunity to earn money. The student interested in advertising can\\nsometimes secure a part-time job writing retail store advertising or preparing\\ncopy for the newspapers. The college print shop is another source for earning\\nmoney. Typesetting, linotype work, and proofreading jobs can frequently be\\nsecured on local publications. This may be part-time work or the student may\\nfind it possible to get work during a rush period when extra help is needed.\\nIf the student is an expert with the camera, he can often make extra money by\\nsnapping pictures of the big football games, track meets, or interesting scenes\\nin his locality. These pictures may be sold to the local papers, to magazines\\nor newspaper syndicates. Pictures should be taken with a sharp angle in mind,\\nthat is, they should emphasize some point or idea. They should be different\\nenough from the average picture of the same sort to at least warrant a second\\nlook. The amateur camera addict can learn a great deal about the market for\\npictures by looking over the current magazine and newspaper picture sections\\nwith a critical eye.chapter tWelVe\\nRAISING MONEY FOR CHARITY\\nD\\nURING the depression there were so many demands upon people to give to\\ncharity that most of the time-honored methods of raising money proved\\ninadequate. Churches, which had always been able to depend upon an annual\\nbazaar for funds, found that the decline in spendable income reduced the net\\nproceeds from such undertakings very substantially. Carnivals, once the main\\nsource of funds for American Legion posts and similar community\\nenterprises, failed to draw nickels and dimes in the needed volume. Even the\\n“Charity Ball” lost its pull. Yet the need for money was greater than ever, and\\nthose responsible for raising the funds had to resort to new innovations.\\nOne outstanding development was the so-called Goodwin plan, which had\\nquite a vogue for a time. The Goodwin Corporation of Chicago arranged with\\na group of manufacturers to list their products in a special catalog. These\\ncatalogs were distributed in quantities to church workers and others with the\\nunderstanding that a commission would be paid by the Goodwin Corporation\\non all orders sent in for products listed in the catalog. Thousands of charitable\\ninstitutions took up the plan, but it met with opposition on the part of local\\nmerchants. They looked upon it as a competitive activity which was taking\\nbusiness away from their stores. Naturally the merchants boycotted the\\nproducts of the manufacturers who went into the plan, and soon the\\nopposition became so pronounced that many discontinued using it.\\nThis experience serves to illustrate one important point that should be given\\nconsideration in any kind of money-raising activity for charity. Is it going to\\ninterfere with the business of local merchants and business men to whom the\\ncommunity owes allegiance? For example, one of the first things most\\nchurches decide to do when they put on an affair is to get out a souvenir\\nprogram and sell advertising to the local merchants at “all the traffic will\\nbear.” Little or no thought is given to the value of the advertising to the\\nmerchant. The common attitude of the promoters is that they have been doing\\nbusiness with these merchants for years, and this will be a good way for them\\nto reciprocate. They overlook the fact that in most cases such advertising is awaste of money, and that the merchants in order to cover their cost of doing\\nbusiness, must add the money thus spent to their prices. Since the big chain\\nstores have a very definite rule that they will not do this kind of advertising,\\nthe “tax” falls upon the independent merchants and tends to make their\\ndifficulty of competing with the chain store even more acute. Thus,\\nunwittingly, these well-intentioned people, in their effort to raise money for a\\nworthy charitable undertaking, help to drive the independent merchants out of\\ntheir communities.\\nFor this reason it is wise in planning a money-raising activity to be careful\\nthat it is tuned to a sound community policy, and that it does not “rob Peter to\\npay Paul.” Fortunately, there are any number of ways for raising money that\\nare not competitive to local business enterprises as the examples which\\nfollow demonstrate.\\nBaby Shows Go Over Big\\nE\\nVERYBODY loves a baby, and there is probably nothing which has so much\\ninterest to the mothers in a community as a baby show and contest. Since the\\nvery nature of such a show is to stimulate interest in better babies, it not only\\nserves as a means of raising money, but it indirectly promotes the sale of\\nmany things sold in the local stores, which babies need. In fact, it is easy to\\nget local merchants to tie in with such a contest, and give good display to\\nposters and advertising.\\nThere are a dozen different plans for holding baby shows. The most popular\\nplan is to have the mothers of the babies bring them in to be shown and\\njudged. Arrange with local merchants to have displays of baby goods in the\\nchurch hall or wherever the contest is held, and charge them a percentage of\\ntheir total sales for the concession. If the community is large enough, the\\ncontest can last several days, a different age group being judged each day. A\\ncommittee of local doctors will gladly serve as judges, and if\\naccommodations permit lectures can be held every hour on some phase of\\nbaby care. Admission is charged, and door prizes awarded. While the amountof money that can be raised from a baby show is limited, it has compensating\\nadvantages from a publicity standpoint. The newspapers will give it a good\\nplay because it offers an opportunity for a human interest story of wide reader\\ninterest.\\nWhite Elephant Sales Are Exciting\\nT\\nHE idea here is to give everybody interested in a charity an opportunity to\\nunload “a white elephant.” This is something one owns but does not need,\\nwhich he is willing to give to charity to raise money. These donations, which\\nshould be of a gift nature, are then brought to the place where the sale is to be\\nheld, and each “prize” is put in a box or wrapped separately. Tickets are sold\\nfor the sale, usually at 25 cents each. The purchasers of the tickets are\\narranged in groups of twenty, and required to sit around in a circle. When\\nthey are so seated each one in the circle is given one of the “blind” packages\\ncontaining some one’s “white elephant.” A leader then asks everyone to pass\\nhis package to the person on his left, and to keep passing it until a bell is\\nrung. When the bell sounds, everybody opens the lid on his package or peeks\\ninto the wrapper to see what it contains. He must not let his neighbors see it\\nhowever. Three minutes are allowed for examination. Those who want to\\nkeep their packages drop out of the circle. The bell rings again, and the\\npackages are started rotating. Another bell, another period of inspection and\\ndecision, and so on until everyone in the circle has a “white elephant.” A time\\nlimit is set and when it is up, those remaining have to take what they hold at\\nthe final bell. This stunt never fails to get a good crowd, and interest runs\\nhigh. It is simply the old grab bag idea in a new suit of clothes. It is not\\nunusual to sell 200 tickets to a single sale, which means ten circles and $50\\nclear profit. Ten such sales a year will net your charity $500. In some\\ncommunities, of course, tickets can be sold for thirty-five or fifty cents which\\nwill make the net amount correspondingly higher. As there is little or no\\nexpense attached to the enterprise, all the money paid for the tickets is clear\\ngain.Home Furnishing Lecture Series\\nT\\nHESE lectures are arranged in cooperation with the local furniture store, the\\nchina store, rug dealer, jeweler, etc. From five to seven women give their\\nhomes for the lectures.\\nThe first lecture might be on period furniture, and the merchant who\\ncooperated would have a display of furniture at the home where the lecture\\nwas to be held, which he would decorate in connection with his talk. The\\nsecond lecture might be on crystal, and an exhibition table displaying various\\nglasses would be arranged before the talk by the lecturer. The third lecture\\nmight be on oriental rugs, always a subject of great interest to women. The\\nlocal rug dealer will be glad to arrange a display of rugs at the home where\\nthe lecture is to be given. The fourth lecture could deal with china. There is\\nan unlimited number of subjects which lend themselves to a series of lectures\\nof this sort: linens, laces, silverware, pictures, lamps— anything and\\neverything that goes to make a home livable. To realize the most out of such\\na series of lectures, tickets should be sold in advance for the entire series. The\\nprice may be nominal—$1.50 for a series of five lectures, or $2.00 for a\\nseries of seven. The advantage of selling a series ticket, rather than permitting\\nthe guests to pay for each lecture at the door is that it insures attendance.\\nBecause such lectures are good advertising for the local merchants they are\\nusually willing to furnish a door prize. Posters announcing the lectures should\\nbe prepared and put up in the stores of those merchants who cooperate in the\\nplan. Organizations such as women’s clubs, churches, etc., which have an\\nauditorium, will find this plan particularly profitable, since such facilities\\npermit a much larger sale of tickets than when the lectures are given at\\nprivate homes in the community.\\nSample Night for Local Merchants\\nT\\nHIS is another idea which is designed to support the independent localmerchants in their fight against chain competition. To stage the affair\\nsuccessfully a large hall is needed. Display space is sold for a nominal\\namount, five to ten dollars, to local merchants. The merchant puts in a display\\nof select merchandise and arranges with as many sources of supply as\\npossible for samples to be distributed from his booth. There is no limit to the\\nnumber of samples that one exhibitor may distribute. Thus the food shop may\\npass out samples of breakfast food, coffee, etc. The druggist may sample such\\nitems as toilet soaps, tooth paste, and medicines. The tobacconist may sample\\ncigarettes, smoking tobacco, etc. The confectioner may pass out samples of\\ngum and candies. These samples will be furnished in most cases without cost\\nto the local merchant by the manufacturer whose advertising budget carries a\\nprovision for this kind of sampling. Some manufacturers will be glad to send\\ndemonstrators to prepare foods, or to demonstrate their products, if invited.\\nTo get out the crowd, a major attraction should be arranged. Door prizes are\\nusually given. These sample nights are quite popular, and it is an easy matter\\nto sell tickets at 25 cents each. In fact, a reasonable charge is desirable to hold\\ndown the number of children attending. Arrangements should be made with a\\npaper house to furnish everyone who attends, a large paper bag with handles\\nto carry home the samples. Additional revenue may be raised by permitting\\nthe exhibitors to sell the products they have on display, paying the\\norganization sponsoring the “Sample Night” a small percentage of their sales\\nin addition to the rental of the space.\\nChristmasPuddingSale\\nI\\nT IS hard to beat a food sale as a means of raising money, especially if\\narrangements can be made with a centrally located store to hold it there. A\\nhardware merchant in Eagle River, Wisconsin, gives one of the churches the\\nuse of his store for one morning each year to hold a bake sale, a feature of\\nwhich is a baking demonstration in the store while the sale is in progress. An\\nelectric range, for which the merchant is the local agent, is used for the\\ndemonstration, and the church gets 10 per cent on all ranges which are sold as\\na result of leads secured during the bake sale. Another charitable organizationin New England makes upward of a thousand dollars annually from its\\nChristmas pudding and mince meat sale held a few days before\\nThanksgiving. An old-fashioned English plum pudding will bring as high as\\n$1.00 a pound at such sales. The usual plan is for the organization to buy the\\nmaterials, and then everyone helps to make the puddings under the direction\\nof someone who is especially good at this sort of thing. The same procedure\\napplies to making the mince meat.\\nChain Luncheons and Card Parties\\nT\\nHIS is a particularly good idea for a suburban community. Each member of\\nthe organization invites four people, and each one attending in turn invites\\nfour others to a luncheon at her home the following week. The process is\\nrepeated until the entire community has been covered.\\nEach hostess plans what shall be done after lunch. Some invite their guests to\\nbring their sewing or knitting, others play cards, and others have readings.\\nThe advantage of the plan is that it does not place too much of a burden on\\nany one hostess. The money is raised by each guest paying fifty cents or a\\ndollar for the luncheon. In order to insure the success of the undertaking, a\\ncommittee is appointed to follow up the guests at each luncheon to make sure\\nthat the chain is not broken. The same idea can be adapted to evening card\\nparties. In that case, however, four couples, rather than four people, comprise\\na chain unit. To add interest to these card parties, rules are set up, and a\\ncertain number of hands are played each evening. At the conclusion of the\\nseries a grand prize is given to the person turning in the highest score. This\\neliminates the necessity of having a prize for each party, which would make a\\nbig hole in the profits.\\nFlorentineFair\\nO\\nNE of the old, dependable methods of raising money for a church or charityis to hold a bazaar; but, because bazaars have become commonplace, they\\nneed to be dramatized in order to attract the crowds.\\nA suburban church did this very successfully by calling its bazaar a\\nFlorentine Fair. The auditorium in which the bazaar was held was decorated\\nto resemble a street scene in Florence, Italy. Colorful hangings were used\\nover the booths and elsewhere around the room, and those who took part in\\nthe bazaar were dressed in the picturesque Italian costumes. A high spot of\\nthe fair was an “open air” restaurant, with bunches of garlic and all the other\\nthings which give atmosphere to a Florence street cafe prominently\\ndisplayed. Street singers strumming Italian melodies added the final touch of\\ncolor to the scene.\\nAs a further attraction, arrangements were made with an importer of Italian\\ndelicacies to have a booth at the fair. Those members of the organization who\\nhad Italian hangings or furniture were asked to lend them for the occasion.\\nThe most popular attractions were the flower booth, with its bevy of dark-\\nhaired flower girls, and the Italian handicrafts booth.\\nThe fair was a great success. Whereas the ordinary bazaar held by this church\\nwould net $1,000, the bazaar with this Florentine setting netted better than\\n$3,000. One of the reasons for this was that the local newspapers gave the\\nfair unusually good publicity because of its humaninterest value.\\nA Mile of Pennies\\nT\\nHE idea here is to induce all the members of an organization and their friends\\nto save their pennies in small cloth bags. Each bag holds sixteen pennies,\\nwhich laid side by side make one foot of pennies. A tag explaining the plan is\\nattached to the bags when they are given out. Since there are sixteen pennies\\nto a foot, and 5,280 feet to a mile, if all the bags are filled and turned in, it\\nwill net an organization $844.80.A Year ’Round Thrift Shop\\nA\\nNUMBER of women’s clubs have been able to obtain a steady income by\\nfixing up a vacant store as a place for selling things various members have\\ndiscarded or wish to dispose of on a commission. The usual plan is to ask\\neach member to give one day a month to looking after the shop. When the\\nshop becomes sufficiently profitable, a permanent attendant may be\\nemployed. The revenue from a store of this kind can be augmented by\\nincluding a circulating library, the books being donated by members of the\\norganization. Because the library is run for charity, no set rental rate is\\ncharged. Those taking out the books are expected to give what they can\\ntoward the work of the organization. They deposit their contribution in a\\nsmall envelope which is pasted inside the front cover of the book, when they\\nreturn the book. An explanation of the plan and the purpose of the charity is\\nprinted on the envelope.\\nAnother good source of revenue for such a shop is selling knitting yarns. One\\nshop of this kind has one of the members of the organization, who is an\\nexpert at knitting, come in one afternoon a week to give instruction in\\nknitting. The yarn is purchased at wholesale as required, so the amount\\ninvested in stock is relatively small.\\nPut on a Dog and Pet Show\\nT\\nHERE are usually people in every community who are very proud of their\\npet dogs. They may be lap dogs, hunting dogs, watch dogs, or “just dogs.”\\nBut whatever type of dog it may be, the owner thinks his dog is better than\\nhis neighbor’s dog. Capitalize on this dog-loving instinct in your community\\nby putting on a local dog show. Prizes in the form of ribbons should be\\nawarded. Because of the many breeds entered, and perhaps the lack of\\npedigrees, prizes are usually awarded for the smallest dog entered, the largest,the prettiest, the funniest, the smartest, the dog with the longest tail, the dog\\nknowing the most tricks, the dog with the largest ears, etc.\\nCountry Fairs Are Always Good\\nT\\nHIS is another form of bazaar which is particularly popular in cities. A barn\\nis usually rented for the fair, and everyone who participates wears a suitable\\ncostume such as overalls and denim shirts or gingham dresses. The feature of\\nthe fair is an old-fashioned barn dance. Various side attractions characteristic\\nof country fairs are used to obtain added interest and revenue.\\nA Prune and Apricot Drive\\nA\\nBOYS’ Scout troop raised enough money to buy all their necessary\\nequipment and had some money left over toward their outdoor activities by\\ncanvassing the community and securing orders for boxes of Santa Clara\\nValley prunes and apricots. Prizes were offered to the scouts who sold the\\ngreatest number of boxes. Arrangements were made with a packing company\\nin the Santa Clara Valley, California, to ship the prunes in season. The same\\nidea can be used with pecan nuts or other specialties, but since prunes are a\\nstaple article and are usually consumed in quantities, most housewives are\\nwilling to buy them by the box or boxes, at the same time helping the boys.\\nProgressive Luncheon and Style Show\\nO\\nNE objection to holding luncheons as a means of raising money for\\ncharitable purposes is the difficulty of handling the crowd. A way to\\novercome this difficulty is to get four or five people in a neighborhood each\\nto serve one course of a luncheon. Thus the appetizers will be served at onehome, the entree at another, the salad at another, and the dessert at still\\nanother. The guests, of course, may come in relays if the homes are small and\\nthe number to be served large.\\nIn order to add interest to the luncheon, a style show or some similar\\nattraction is held at the same time. At the first home there might be a showing\\nof house dresses by a local dress shop which specializes in garments of that\\nkind. At the next home sports wear and millinery might be shown, afternoon\\ndresses at the next, and evening dresses and wraps at another home. In each\\ncase the models are offered for sale, and the organization receives a\\ncommission on the sales made.\\nSpringGardenCarnival\\nT\\nHE open-air flower and garden sale which has become an institution in\\nEvanston, Illinois, is sponsored by the Garden Club of Evanston. The city\\nsquare is used for the event which lasts two or three days. Club members save\\ntheir seeds and bulbs from the preceding season and place them in envelopes\\nfor sale. Each envelope bears the name of the person who grew the seeds.\\nOther club members contribute potted flowers from their greenhouses or\\nhotbeds. Concessions are sold to pottery manufacturers on a commission\\nbasis, and local merchants are invited to take part and sell all sorts of garden\\ntools and supplies, paying a small commission for the privilege. In addition to\\nthe spring flowers and garden accessories, there is a food booth that does a\\nland office business, and the usual concessions that go to make a street fair a\\nreal event for a youngster.\\n“DaysofForty-Nine”Celebration\\nA\\nNOTHER variation of the charity bazaar is to hold it in a setting which has\\nthe atmosphere of the California gold rush. The principal money-makingattraction for such a bazaar is the dance hall with its various gambling\\ndevices and tables. In cities where gambling is prohibited, those attending are\\n“sold” a package of stage money at the door, which is used at the various\\ntables in place of currency. At the end of the evening, prizes are given to\\nthose holding the most greenbacks. One organization built up attendance by\\nparading an old covered wagon and a team of oxen through the streets for\\nseveral days before the fair opened.\\nSpringGardenTours\\nI\\nN COMMUNITIES where there are unusually fine gardens, charitable\\norganizations are able to raise considerable money by getting the owners of\\nthese gardens to set aside one day each spring for visitors. Books of tickets\\nentitle the holder to admission to the various gardens, a ticket for each garden\\nto be torn out as used. The usual price is fifty cents for a book of ten tickets.\\n“DoubleYour-Dollar”Contest\\nA\\nT THE beginning of the season each member of an organization is given one\\ndollar from the treasury. With that money he is supposed to buy something to\\nmake or sell, and turn back at least $2.00 at the end of the season. There is,\\nhowever, no limit to the amount of money which can be made from the\\ndollar. Prizes are offered to those who “turn” their dollars the greatest number\\nof times.\\n“MostTreasuredPossession”Exhibit\\nI\\nN LOCALITIES made up of well-to-do families, each family usually has a\\nmuseum piece of some kind—work of art, a book, shawls, an ornament, astamp or coin collection, a piece of lace, or some other “treasured\\npossession.” These people are invited by the committee in charge of the affair\\nto place such things on exhibition in one of the larger homes in the\\ncommunity on a specified day. Cards are typewritten giving interesting\\nparticulars about each exhibit and the name of the person who loaned it.\\nInvitations are then sent to everybody in the neighborhood, who might be\\ninterested, to bring their friends. Admission may be charged or, if tea is\\nserved, contributions may be made as they are at a silver tea.\\nHostesses, Incorporated\\nT\\nHE New York League of Girls’ Clubs needed money. The League was the\\npet project of Mrs. Courtlandt D. Barnes and it was up to her to find a way to\\nget some money. From time to time she had helped friends with various\\nproblems by calling upon the League for assistance. Someone in the League\\nalways knew someone else who could handle the particular job to be done.\\nWith this experience to work on, Mrs. Barnes did not see why an\\norganization could not be built up that would make money for the League.\\nAfter talking it over with several friends, it was decided that the idea was a\\nsound one, so “Hostesses, Incorporated” was organized. Miss Louise Evans\\nwas placed in charge and given one assistant. These two were the only ones\\non the staff who were paid full-time salaries. In reserve is a large staff of part-\\ntime employees. All profits, of course, go to the League.\\nOver the period of years it has been in existence, the organization has built up\\na staff which is capable of covering any emergency call. The call may be for\\na flying instructor, someone to close or open an apartment, someone to\\nentertain out-of-town clients, a chaperon, a nurse, advice on a travel\\nwardrobe, a plumber, a correspondence course in etiquette, someone to take\\ncare of the baby, secure transportation to any part of the world—Miss Evans\\nwill handle the problem without batting an eyelash. She will also arrange to\\nhave someone move your office over the weekend, someone to buy your old\\nclothes and sell them for you, someone to prepare papers and speeches foryou, to write letters, to take your child to school or home for the holidays.\\nNothing is too simple or too difficult for her to handle. Since the organization\\nof “Hostesses, Incorporated,” hundreds of dollars have found their way into\\nthe treasury of the League, work has been provided for many who needed it,\\nand not a few business men or householders have had their problems neatly\\nand quickly solved.\\nchapter thIrteen\\nBEYOND THE FIRST THOUSAND\\nT\\nHERE is a saying, the wisdom of which was impressed upon many during\\nthe recent depression, to the effect that it is easier to make money than it is to\\nkeep it. The man who is out to make his first thousand dollars has but to seize\\nan opportunity, and if he applies himself intelligently he is reasonably sure of\\na measure of success—certainly under normal conditions he should easily\\nmake a thousand dollars. In the preceding chapters you have read how\\nhundreds of men and women have accomplished that objective. But after all,\\nthis first thousand dollars is only the first rung of the ladder. Having one foot\\non the ladder you are now faced with temptations which did not bother you\\nwhen your major concern was making that first thousand.\\nFirst, there will come the temptation to rest on your oars and take it easy now\\nthat you are “in the money.” You fought a good fight and won. Being a\\nnormal human being you feel that your efforts have entitled you to the\\nrewards of victory. So you buy a new automobile, take a trip or do any one of\\na dozen things that you have been planning to do when you made some\\nmoney. But one swallow does not make a summer. If you squander your\\nmoney for a good time now, you will have nobody but yourself to blame if\\nyou must spend your old age dependent upon the State or relatives.\\nThe real test of your business ability and your capacity for success is not\\nbehind you. It lies directly ahead of you. Are you going to take that first\\nthousand dollars and use it as a seedling for a real fortune, and a place in the\\nsun? Or are you going to treat it as a small boy treats a dime given him for a\\nSaturday night lark? You may think, as thousands of others have thought,“Now that I have the secret of making money, nothing can stop me.” There is\\ndanger in that philosophy, for you are now in a position where you are more\\nlikely to attract the attention of men who are looking for “suckers” with a\\nthousand dollars in the bank. Soon it will be noised about town that you are\\nmaking money, that you are prosperous, that you are even wealthy. Men will\\nbegin to “proposition” you. One of these men will have a sure-fire way of\\nmaking money without working. All you have to do is to buy some stock in a\\ncompany that is being formed. Another has inside information about an oil\\nlease and there is a million dollars waiting for those who are smart enough to\\nget in on the ground floor.\\nMake no mistake, for every person who has made a thousand dollars\\nspeculating, a thousand have lost. If there is a substitute for patient\\napplication and hard work, so far as making a permanent place for yourself in\\nthis world is concerned, no one has yet found it.\\nGenerally speaking, you cannot make money playing the other fellow’s\\ngame. However plausible his reasons may be for putting money into his\\nbusiness, remember that nine out of ten new ventures fail. There is only one\\nchance in ten of your getting your money back. There are many successful\\nbusiness men who have an ironclad rule never to put money into any kind of\\nbusiness enterprise that they do not control. That does not mean that they\\nwould not invest in the common stocks of established companies with a long\\nearning record, which is more in the nature of an investment than a\\nspeculation, but they will not put money in any new enterprise unless they\\ncontrol it.\\nGood Advice from a Veteran Financier\\nFormer Secretary of the Treasury, Andrew Mellon, in a notable interview to\\nthe press just before the 1929 crash, pointed out that most common stocks\\nwere overpriced and by implication advised people who were “in the market”\\nto put their money into bonds. He laid down eleven principles on handling\\nmoney, which are well worth keeping in mind when that first thousand\\ndollars begins to burn a hole in your pocket and you are considering how you\\ncan pyramid it into a fortune without work! Mr. Mellon’s eleven pointsfollow:\\n“Never buy stocks in mines you know nothing about. Shun alluring promises\\nabout mines in a faraway land.\\n“None but the rich can afford to trifle with oil wells.\\n“A patent may be only the right to a lawsuit. Schemers take advantage of\\nevery important discovery and invention, and some have nothing but\\npromises to sell.\\n“Do you want to buy a swamp? There are real estate promoters who will sell\\nyou swamps as ‘shore frontage.’ If you buy property, buy near home.\\n“Look out for new companies that are going to sell by mail. They may never\\nearn more than salary money, and that is paid out.\\n“New manufacturing methods should always be personally checked and\\ninvestigated.\\n“‘Invest quick or it may be too late’ is the favorite urge of wild cat stock\\nsalesmen. That should make you suspicious.\\n“Look with suspicion on offers with special inducements in cash discounts or\\nstock bonuses.\\n“Your banker will tell you that ‘tips’ on the stock market are worthless. Do\\nnot think you will be let in ‘on the ground floor.’\\n“The rich man can afford to speculate. If he loses he has other money in the\\nbank. Not so the small investor. Never play the stock market on ‘margin.’\\n“Stock in companies being organized on the success of others, rarely turns\\nout well. Do not put your money into another man’s dreams.”\\nYou say that is good advice, yet look at the fortunes that have been made by\\nthe men who put money into Ford’s business, and Standard Oil and other\\nnow well-known enterprises. Where would they have been if they had\\ninvested only in properties?\\nYou Can’t Beat the “Kitty”\\nThere are exceptions to every rule. There are men who have played the stock\\nmarket all their lives and made money at it. There are men who have played\\nthe races and made money doing it. There are men who have bought tickets\\nin the Louisiana Lottery and have drawn winning numbers which paid them\\nthousands. But always remember that you can’t beat the “kitty.” If you playthe stock market, the horse races, and poker long enough, the broker and the\\nbookmaker and the “kitty” will get it all. You hear of a great many rich\\nbankers who are satisfied with 6 per cent. But how many times can you\\nremember hearing of a speculator or a gambler dying wealthy? They make\\nmoney, but they usually lose it equally fast. Most of them die in poverty.\\nAccording to an analysis made by one of the large insurance companies, the\\naverage earnings on a lifetime investment are less than 4 ½ per cent. This, it\\nwill be noted, is less than the income from a gilt-edge bond. One would\\nnaturally think that during a man’s lifetime he would make a number of\\ninvestments which would pay him large returns, in addition to his\\ninvestments in bonds and mortgages yielding a conventional return. But on\\nthe contrary, the yield from speculative investments is shown to be less than\\ntheir yield from gilt-edged securities over a period of time.\\nThis is not hard to understand. Suppose you do make 10 or 15 per cent on\\nsome “long shot” investment. The next time you are likely to lose everything\\nyou put into the investment, and this loss would more than neutralize your\\nprevious winnings. The worthless stocks which a man usually acquires before\\nattaining mature judgment, not only represent a loss of principal, but a loss of\\nfour or five times as much again in compound interest.\\nA Concrete Illustration\\nTo make this last point clear, let us assume that two business men, yourself\\nand one of your friends, had $1,000 in the bank at the time the\\nCommonwealth Hotel stock was being sold, and that you were each thirty\\nyears of age at that time.\\nYour friend, carried away by the promise of handsome dividends, put his\\nthousand into the stock of the hotel company and lost it. The idea of putting\\nmoney into another man’s dream did not appeal to you, so you bought a 6 per\\ncent bond in a well-seasoned business.\\nWe will suppose further that you had promptly reinvested the interest from\\nyour bond, in other approved 6 per cent securities, as the interest was paid to\\nyou every six months.Fifty years have passed. You are now eighty years old, and ready to retire.\\nLet us see what has happened. The thousand dollars which you had invested\\nin a gilt-edge bond grew to $1,806 when you were forty. By fifty it had\\nclimbed to $3,262. At sixty it had reached $5,891 and by seventy the $5,891\\nhad grown to $10,640. Today, at eighty, your original $1,000, with a little\\nnourishing and watching, amounts to nearly $20,000 which, invested at 5 per\\ncent, will give you an annual income of $1,000 a year for the rest of your life.\\nBy playing safe and exercising banker’s caution you made $19,000 on your\\noriginal investment. By looking for big returns, rather than safety, your friend\\nlost $20,000. That is the difference between investing money, and speculating\\nwith it. It is not so much the loss of your original investment which should\\nworry you but the loss of the compound interest on that investment. Get\\nacquainted with compound interest. It is a wonderful discovery.\\nThe Best Investment for a Business Man\\nThere are many ways of investing money safely. Some think that building\\nand loan associations are the best. Others favor first mortgages on good\\nproperty. Others cannot see anything but listed bonds. Still others prefer\\nseasoned preferred stocks. The plain truth of the matter is that there is no\\n“best” investment. The best investment for one man, may easily be the worst\\ninvestment for another. It depends on a great many conditions besides the\\nvalue of the proposition itself.\\nThe depression has proved the wisdom of the old advice to diversify your\\ninvestments, and not put all your eggs in one basket. After you have\\naccumulated a working reserve, it may also be advisable to set aside a part of\\nyour savings for the purchase of listed stocks with a long dividend record,\\nwhich you think should enhance in value. Speculation in even listed stocks,\\nshould never be attempted unless one can afford to lose, and does not need\\nthe additional income.\\nBuy old issues at the bottom . Select an industry, closely allied to national\\nprosperity, which is temporarily depressed.\\nBuy bonds with a high collateral value—meaning bonds on which a bankwill loan you up to 80 per cent. You can never tell when unforeseen\\nconditions may make it necessary for you to raise money quickly. The sum\\nneeded may be just a little more than the collateral value of your bond, in\\nwhich case you would have to sell it perhaps at a time when values were\\ndepressed. Bonds on high collateral value are usually “listed”—an additional\\nadvantage.\\nBuy bonds in as large denominations as possible, as the banker or broker\\ncharges a minimum fee for selling your bond. As a rule this fee is based on\\n$1,000 units. It is easier to keep track of a few bonds of higher\\ndenominations, than it is a lot of baby bonds. The only advantage in having\\nfive $100’s instead of one $500 is in case you wish to dispose of one of the\\nbonds. For a business man, however, it is better to borrow on a bond than to\\nsell it.\\nFew outside investments, however, are as good for a business man as his own\\nbusiness. You may not want to put all your money into expanding your\\nbusiness, but beware of those who tell you that you are foolish to plow back\\nthe earnings of your business into buildings and equipment. They will tell\\nyou that it is better to put your surplus in the stock market where it can make\\n10 or 20 per cent, whereas the best you could earn would be 5 or 10.\\nAn Anchor to Windward\\nThere is more to making money than merely allowing for a return on your\\ncapital. When you put your money back into your business you are buying\\nprotection against the next downward swing of the business cycle, and don’t\\never forget that it will come down some day, just as it may be going up today.\\nIf you have a business of your own, with the plant and equipment paid for,\\nand you are free and clear of debt, you have nothing to fear, however hard the\\nwinds of depression blow. You have in effect built yourself a cyclone cellar.\\nAnd no matter what you may be told, a cyclone cellar is mighty handy in a\\ncountry where business is one long series of ups and downs. Most of those\\nwho make money when the tide is coming in, lose it when the tide runs out.\\nThat is why, if you are wise, you will take advantage of good times to put out\\na shore anchor against the day when the tide ebbs.\\nNever be stampeded by crowd movements. All the great fortunes that havebeen made in the financial world have been made by “playing the market\\nagainst the crowd.” In other words, never buy when there are more buyers\\nthan sellers, and never sell when there are more sellers than buyers. Buy\\nwhen it is the fashion to sell, and sell when it is the fashion to buy. To quote\\nHerbert N. Casson, a well-known financial writer: “Most people are optimists\\nduring a boom, and pessimists during a depression. It is the natural way. But\\nthe man who makes money is the man who is a pessimist during a boom, and\\nan optimist during a depression. Always buy from pessimists. Always sell to\\noptimists.” You can make a lot of money by following this advice when\\ninvesting your first thousand.\\nAPPENDICES APPENDIX A\\nRetail and Wholesale Operating Budgets336\\n APPENDIX B\\nSources of Supply\\nSources of Supply\\nT\\nHE accompanying list has been compiled to help you to get in touch with\\nmanufacturers of equipment which you may require to start your business, as\\nwell as the supplies and merchandise that you need to operate it.

            "{'output_text': 'James C. Penney’s first job paid him $2.27 a month. Thirty-two years later, he was the successful head of a great business, with more than 1,000 partners. He was just the average small-town country boy. Was it luck? Not at all. It was a combination of enthusiasm, vision, and singleness of purpose, backed up by work. He admits that hard work alone will not bring you success. But hard work and a definite goal will do the trick.\\n\\nAfter clerking for some time in a store owned by T. M. Callahan and his partner, young Penney was offered a chance to become a partner in the business, with a new store to manage. His savings amounted to $500—not nearly enough. But the two partners agreed to lend him the additional amount needed at 8 percent. However, Penney was shrewd for his years, so he shopped around and found he could borrow the amount from a bank at 6 percent.\\n\\nThe new store opened April 14, 1902, with a capital of $6,000, a third of which was Penney’s.
